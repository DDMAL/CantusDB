## OldCantus vs. NewCantus

This repository contains code for "NewCantus," an updated version of Cantus Database built in Django. "OldCantus", built in Drupal, can be accessed at https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca.

Discrepancies between text stored in the CantusDB database and the manuscript text are compiled by testers in the following Google Spreadsheets: 
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133lVOVM15l7a6bQKIQije4op363ragG4OXewYop_cbQ/edit#gid=0 (Salzinnes)
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zPq-6p8hklKKfTa5A4DXYpwOPOIi41Z7JoAfdGVKzig/edit#gid=0 (Einsiedeln)

### Differences in functionality/behavior:
#### Visible to All Users (Logged-In and Anonymous)
- General:
  - The formatting/style of the entire site is slightly different.
  - In some places, links (to Genre, Office, Feast detail pages, etc.) have been added where there were no links in OldCantus.
  - In some places, title attributes have been added, especially where abbreviations are displayed (visible on mouse-over).
- Homepage:
  - When logged out, OldCantus displays a sidebar displaying recently posted articles. NewCantus displays this sidebar, but only displays the articles' titles, rather than the full content of the article (Currently, we don't plan to display the full content of news articles here)
- Article List page:
  - Images from within the news stories are not displayed on the Article List page, whereas they are in OldCantus. (Currently, we don't plan to display images on this page)
  - Articles were manually copied from OldCantus to New, and when I initially did this, I preserved the date but not the time. It's fine that most of the timestamps say "00:00".
- Several of the APIs from OldCantus are not implemented in NewCantus, or are implemented differently:
  - json-activity (accessed via https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-activity and https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-activity?all) is not implemented in NewCantus ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/126))
  - json-analysis-export (accessed, we think, via [https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-analysis-export/?src=\<source id\>](https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-analysis-export/?src=123591)) is not implemented in NewCantus ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/124))
  - some of the keys in the json generated by json-node (accessed via [https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-node/\<id\>](https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-node/123591)) are different in NewCantus ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/106))
  - in the csv API, if the source in question has only sequences and no chants, OldCantus outputs a csv file with only a header and no rows. In this situation, NewCantus outputs a list of all the sequences in the source using the same headers as for chant sources.
- all people are represented as Users in NewCantus. This is in contrast to OldCantus, where there were two separate lists of people: one of Indexers and one of Users. ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/218))

#### Logged-In Users
- on the edit-volpiano page, there are some additional links in NewCantus that were previously unclickable text in OldCantus ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/253))
