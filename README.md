# OldCantus vs. NewCantus

Known Differences in functionality/behavior between OldCantus and NewCantus

## Visible to All Users (Logged-In and Anonymous)
- very soon, all people will be represented as Users in NewCantus. This is in contrast to OldCantus, where there were two separate lists of people: one of Indexers and one of Users. ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/218))
- Several of the APIs from OldCantus are not implemented in NewCantus, or are implemented differently:
  - json-activity (accessed via https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-activity and https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-activity?all) is not implemented in NewCantus ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/126))
  - json-analysis-export (accessed, we think, via [https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-analysis-export/?src=\<source id\>](https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-analysis-export/?src=123591)) is not implemented in NewCantus ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/124))
  - some of the keys in the json generated by json-node (accessed via [https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-node/\<id\>](https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/json-node/123591)) are different in NewCantus ([Discussion](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB/issues/106))
- Articles from the "Recent News" items in OldCantus have not yet been imported to NewCantus
