"""
some useful info taken from the text entry guideline:
the symbols are present only in the MS spelling, not std spelling
vertical stroke | identifies sections within a chant, it's meant to help align text with melody
  should be surrounded by spaces
tilda ~ identifies "Psalm incipits" or any text that doesn't align with pitches
  immediately before text, no spaces
IPSUM (same), it looks like: | space ï½žIpsum space [actual psalm text from the antiphon]
  this doesn't affect alignment, just treat the part between ~ and next | as one syllable in one word

                                  MISSING TEXT WITH READABLE PITCHES
the number sign # identifies missing text, it could be missing complete word(s) or syllable(s)
  complete words missing: space # space
  partially visible word (syllables missing): - (one hyphen represents missing syllables) then space # space for missing section of text
  volpiano for the section with missing text: -- between neumes, begin and end section with --- (always treat the section as a word?)

                                  READABLE TEXT UNDER MISSING PITCHES
for a complete word:
  enclose affected text in {} and don't syllabize them,
  volpiano use 6------6 to represent missing pitches, --- before and after each 6

for select syllables:
  enclose affected syllable(s) in {},
  volpiano use 6------6 to represent missing pitches, no --- before and after each 6???
In either case, the 6*6 align with {*}

                                  MISSING BOTH PITCHES AND TEXT
no text, no pitches visible:
  {#} indicates missing text,
  if partial word readable, use - for the missing sylable(s) and then enter space {#} space for the remainder of missing text
  volpiano use 6------6 as described above

no pitches, partial text visible:
  enclose affected text in {}, use - for the missing portions of words
  use # within {} to indicate location of missing text
  volpiano use 6------6 as described above

there should never be a space in volpiano. hyphens do the separation and spacing.
