# some useful info taken from the text entry guideline:
# the symbols are present only in the MS spelling, not std spelling
# vertical stroke | identifies sections within a chant, it's meant to help align text with melody
#   should be surrounded by spaces
# tilda ~ identifies "Psalm incipits" or any text that doesn't align with pitches
#   immediately before text, no spaces
# IPSUM (same), it looks like: | space ï½žIpsum space [actual psalm text from the antiphon]
#   this doesn't affect alignment, just treat the part between ~ and next | as one syllable in one word

#                                   MISSING TEXT WITH READABLE PITCHES
# the number sign # identifies missing text, it could be missing complete word(s) or syllable(s)
#   complete words missing: space # space
#   partially visible word (syllables missing): - (one hyphen represents missing syllables) then space # space for missing section of text
#   volpiano for the section with missing text: -- between neumes, begin and end section with --- (always treat the section as a word?)

#                                   READABLE TEXT UNDER MISSING PITCHES
# for a complete word:
#   enclose affected text in {},
#   volpiano use 6------6 to represent missing pitches, --- before and after each 6

# for select syllables:
#   enclose affected syllable(s) in {},
#   volpiano use 6------6 to represent missing pitches, no --- before and after each 6???
# In either case, the 6*6 align with {*}

#                                   MISSING BOTH PITCHES AND TEXT
# no text, no pitches visible:
#   {#} indicates missing text,
#   if partial word readable, use - for the missing sylable(s) and then enter space {#} space for the remainder of missing text
#   volpiano use 6------6 as described above

# no pitches, partial text visible:
#   enclose affected text in {}, use - for the missing portions of words
#   use # within {} to indicate location of missing text
#   volpiano use 6------6 as described above


# there should never be a space in volpiano. hyphens do the separation and spacing.
