    <description>Sequentiary is marred by three lacunae:  between 43 and 44, between 49 and 50, and between 50 and 51.  Only single folios appear to be missing between first two, but several are missing between last two, based on missing feasts of Assumptio bMv and Nativitas bMv.  Fragment of one text (Ad celebres) for Michael present on fragment, but a germanic text was probably also present.</description>

    <summary>Fourteenth-century antiphoner in two volumes (with A-Gu 30) from the Abbey of Sankt Lambrecht (Steiermark, Austria). Monastic cursus. 382 and 376 fols.</summary>

    <description>Differentiae are indicated in the margins of both A-Gu 29 and A-Gu 30 using the two-letter system (one letter for mode, one for differentia) found in Switzerland and some regions of Germany and Austria. These tonary letters are given in the differentia field of the indexed records. The Arabic numerals in the field for mode have been supplied by the Cantus staff on the basis of the tonary letters. A few unusual tonary letters in Graz 30 (34r, 36v, 38r, 50r, 120r, and 221r), which appear to be &quot;m,&quot; have been interpreted instead as &quot;w,&quot; that is, omega. The index does not distinguish between tonary letters in the original series and those that appear written over or in place of an earlier designation.Some differentiae have been notated on the staff instead of, or in addition to, a tonary letter (for example, in Graz 29, 65v, 149r, 253v, 268r, 285r, and 344v). Such notated differentiae may or may not match those found in the tonary (Graz 29, ff. 377r-379r). No attempt has been made in the indexed records to indicate when differentiae are notated, even if they differ from what is implied by the tonary letter in the margin. Some antiphons without tonary letters include differentiae notated on the staff. When these could be matched to tonary letters through reference to the manuscript tonary, the appropriate letters have been supplied.Ff. 199-204 in Graz 29 are the work of a different text hand inserted, out of liturgical order, before the Sanctorale section of the manuscript (Andrew, 205r). Therefore, the group of folios that precedes them (ff. 187-198, containing polyphonic settings of the Solemn Readings for Christmas) may also have been added to the manuscript at a later date, between the Temporale and Sanctorale sections. The hand of these folios containing polyphony, however, is more similar to the main body of the manuscript. The ends of both manuscripts appear to include a few folios appended at a later date.The two volumes overlap in interesting ways. Although only slightly longer, Graz 29 contains some unusual items (tones for the Lamentations of Jeremiah, 168v; the Office of the Dead, 352v; the Invitatory Tones, 363v; the Tonary, 377r; Polyphonic Settings, 187r and 379r) which are not included in Graz 30. By contrast, Graz 30 contains the majority of the important occasions of the Sanctorale. Both manuscripts include the Commons, a fortunate duplication because a folio lost in the Common of Virgins in Graz 30 (between ff. 369 and 370) may be reconstructed from Graz 29, beginning on f. 346r.The Commons in Graz 30 were probably copied from Graz 29, judging by the stray rubric (&amp;ldquo;In commemoratione animarum fidelium&amp;rdquo;) added by the copyist at the bottom of f. 374v. In Graz 29, this rubric precedes the Office of the Dead, after the Commons, which the scribe evidently copied into Graz 30 before deciding not to include that Office in the second volume. It is uncertain how much time may have elapsed between the production of the two volumes, but there are a few differences between the two versions of the Commons.In addition, the end of the summer Sanctorale in Graz 30 (Saturninus, 324r; Andrew, 324v; Nicholas, 330v; the Octave of Andrew, 336v; and Damasus, 336v) overlaps the beginning of the Advent Sanctorale in Graz 29 (Andrew, 205r; Nicholas, 212r; the Octave of Andrew, 219r; and Damasus, 219r). Comparison of these sections of the two manuscripts reveals some interesting changes in the Abbey liturgy in the period between the production of the two volumes. The feast of Saturninus appears to have been added in this time; incipits for the Magnificat and Benedictus antiphons as found in Graz 30 (324r-v) have been added to Graz 29 in the top margin of f. 205r.An antiphon intended for a procession after Lauds on St. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Day (Graz 29, 211v) appears, by its absence from Graz 30 (330r), to have been removed from that function. The Benedictus antiphon selected for Damasus is different in Graz 29 and 30, although both are Common antiphons. The few minor variants which may be observed between versions of individual melodies in the two manuscripts (for example, the antiphon &amp;ldquo;Ambulans Jesus juxta mare&amp;rdquo;) suggest that the copyist of Graz 30 may have worked at least in part from memory rather than slavishly copying melodies from Graz 29 into Graz 30.The Polyphony in Graz, Universitätsbibliothek, 29 and 30Graz 29 and 30 present the solemn record of a highly developed body of music for the Office as it was celebrated at the Austrian monastery of Sankt Lambrecht. Among the important aspects of the abbey&amp;rsquo;s musical sophistication, the large number of polyphonic pieces is perhaps the most obvious. Two thirds of this important repertory--approximately sixty hymns, conductus, responsory verses and doxologies--has already been indexed in Gilbert Reaney, ed., Repertoire International des Sources Musicales, series B, no. 4, Manuscripts of Polyphonic Music (c. 1320- 1400) (Munich: G. Henle Verlag, 1969), 2: 327-333. These items are listed in Tables I &amp; II. The other polyphonic settings in Graz 29 and Graz 30 have remained unknown. The opportunity afforded to CANTUS in compiling complete indices of these two manuscripts has made it possible to remedy this problem. Tables III &amp; IV list all polyphony--responsory verses and doxologies--not indexed by RISM.TABLE IPolyphonic Items in GRAZ 29 Catalogued in RISMFolio#FeastNameGenreIncipit187r01Nativitas DominiMGaudens in domino in hoc187v01Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri187v02Nativitas DominiLPrimo tempore alleviata est189v03Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri190r01Nativitas DominiLPrimo tempore alleviata est192r02Nativitas DominiMJube domne benedicere192r03Nativitas DominiLConsolamini consolamini194v01Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri194v02Nativitas DominiLConsurge consurge induere197r03Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri197r04Nativitas DominiLSalvator noster dilectissimi202v01AgnetisVGloria patri et filio et203r01AgnetisVGloria patri et filio et289v01GregoriiVA domino factum est istud et289v02GregoriiVGloria patri et filio et291r02GregoriiVMemor esto congregationis291r03GregoriiVGloria patri et filio et293v01BenedictiVGloria patri et filio et293v02BenedictiIUt Christo celebri jubilemus [Intonation only]297r01BenedictiVPer te ducem clarissimum ut297r02BenedictiVGloria patri et filio et301r01Annuntiatio MariaeVO sancta et benedicta o301v01Annuntiatio MariaeVGloria patri et filio et303v01Annuntiatio MariaeVQuoniam peccatorum mole303v02Annuntiatio MariaeVGloria patri et filio et305v01Annuntiatio MariaeVGloria patri parilique proli379r01HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerum379r02HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerum379v01HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerum379v02HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerumTABLE IIPolyphonic Items in GRAZ 30 Catalogued in RISMFolio#FeastNameGenreIncipit108r02In Dedicatione Eccl.VVidit Jacob in somnis scalam108v01In Dedicatione Eccl.VGloria patri et filio et112r02In Dedicatione Eccl.VGloria patri et filio et172r01Transl.

VirginumVGloria patri et filio etThe polyphonic item in Graz 29 &amp;ldquo;Constantes estote videbitis&amp;rdquo; was added by a later hand in the lower margin of f. 37v, where the original monophonic melodies of both verse and doxology found in the main body of the page reappear with discant voices added to them. Four small staves have been added to accommodate this musical material. This item may have been excluded from the list of polyphonic items in RISM because it was a later addition to the manuscript; yet the verse &amp;ldquo;Per te ducem&amp;rdquo; for Benedict&amp;rsquo;s Translation [Graz 30, 172r] was included there even though its polyphonic version appears on an added half-folio inserted into the manuscript.In Graz 30 the polyphony not listed in RISM is disguised by the fact that the added voices were written in the lower margin of the page rather than next to the chants. The discants for the two verses for the Nativity of Mary [247r, 249r] were added in the lower margin in a text hand and musical notation similar to those of the original body of the manuscript. In the remaining five added discants, the text hand is similar to that of the original script but the staff notation is of a later type. In all five cases, the voice added to the doxology was notated in the lower margin of the preceding folio. In two cases [334r, 357r] doxologies with discant were added on two staves for responsories that did not originally include doxologies.There is some consistency in the liturgical assignment of responsory verses for which polyphony is supplied. With one exception, each of the final responsories for Matins in the Commons of Graz 30 has a polyphonic verse; the exception is the Common of Apostles. (The Commons in Graz 29, in most respects quite similar to those of Graz 30, lack the added voice parts.) The non-standard verse melodies are the same in both manuscripts [in Graz 29, &amp;ldquo;Tradiderunt,&amp;rdquo; 322v; &amp;ldquo;Immortalis,&amp;rdquo; 332r; &amp;ldquo;Vigilate,&amp;rdquo; 340v; &amp;ldquo;Eructavit,&amp;rdquo; 350r]. Actually, the verse &amp;ldquo;Tradiderunt&amp;rdquo; is set to both non-standard and standard verse formulae in both manuscripts.A single musical style is common to all Sankt Lambrecht polyphony, both for those items included in the main body of the manuscript and the marginal items. A cantor familiar with the rules for producing this type of discant might have been able to improvise an accompaniment to a familiar melody, much as fauxbourdon was used to ornament a single line. In fact, the marginal discants in both manuscripts may be the results of--or plans for--such improvisations. The fact that not all responsories include polyphonic intonations for the respond after the verse may reflect the relative ease with which a cantor could have improvised the discant part.The polyphonic musical style in these manuscripts is primarily homophonic with the discant matching the original melody neume for neume. This is true of the simplest items (such as the second &amp;ldquo;Jube domne silentium,&amp;rdquo; Graz 29, 189v, which is basically an ornamented recitation tone) as well as more melismatic pieces (such as &amp;ldquo;Per te ducem,&amp;rdquo; Graz 29, 297r, or Graz 30, 172r). A single pitch is occasionally held for the duration of several pitches in the opposite voice (see the first &amp;ldquo;Jube domne silentium,&amp;rdquo; Graz 29, 187v, the final neume of each strophe). Furthermore, this single pitch may be notated either as several repeated puncta or as a long (compare in the same piece the ending of the first and second strophes).The discant voice stays most commonly at the interval of a perfect fifth and progresses in parallel motion with the chant. In order to preserve the perfect fifth, E-flats are usually notated in the accompanying part when B-flats occur in the principal voice. In cases where there is contrary motion, perfect intervals (unison, fifth, octave, and the occasional fourth) are strictly maintained between the two voices. An exception is the occasional third that results from contrary motion in passing from a fifth to a unison, or vice versa. This rigorous maintenance of certain intervals occasionally produces discant lines that are rather disjunct (such as the opening of the discant for the verse &amp;ldquo;Inter choros confessorum&amp;rdquo; for Benedict, Graz 29, 293r).When other Austrian manuscripts are examined, the Sankt Lambrecht polyphony proves even more interesting. All responsory verses set polyphonically in Graz 29 and 30 involve non-standard melodies. Comparison of indices in the Cantus database facilitates the study of these melodies, which are often part of numerical series (such as in the late Offices for Benedict or Gregory). Rather than being modal formulae, as are standard responsory verses, these melodies are individual compositions transmitted from source to source with few changes. Most of these special melodies have a rather wide geographical distribution, and many appear in the other Austrian sources indexed by Cantus--Vorau 287 (from Salzburg) and Klosterneuburg 1017 and 1018 (from Klosterneuburg). The melodies for Commons responsory verses also appear in the Commons of both other sources either in Vespers or as supplemental Matins responsories. The musicians of Sankt Lambrecht sought to elaborate these special melodies even further by adding discant voices. The fourth melody for the hymn &amp;ldquo;Te lucis ante terminum&amp;rdquo; [Graz 29, 379v] has also been added to Vorau 287 for hymn texts for the feast of the Immaculate Conception (&amp;ldquo;Maria mater domini aeterni&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Maria virgo regia ex stirpe,&amp;rdquo; 311v) and for Anne (&amp;ldquo;Assunt Annae sollemnia,&amp;rdquo; 319r). The discant lines, however, appear to be unique to Sankt Lambrecht.</description>

    <description>Differentiae are indicated in the margins of both A-Gu 29 and A-Gu 30 using the two-letter system (one letter for mode, one for differentia) found in Switzerland and some regions of Germany and Austria. These tonary letters are given in the differentia field of the computer index. The Arabic numerals in the field for mode have been supplied by the CANTUS staff on the basis of the tonary letters. A few unusual tonary letters in Graz 30 (34r, 36v, 38r, 50r, 120r, and 221r), which appear to be &quot;m,&quot; have been interpreted instead as &quot;w,&quot; that is, omega. The index does not distinguish between tonary letters in the original series and those that appear written over or in place of an earlier designation.Some differentiae have been notated on the staff instead of or in addition to a tonary letter (for example, in Graz 29, 65v, 149r, 253v, 268r, 285r, and 344v). Such notated differentiae may or may not match those found in the tonary (Graz 29, ff. 377r-379r). No attempt has been made in the index to indicate when differentiae are notated, even if they differ from what is implied by the tonary letter in the margin. Some antiphons without tonary letters include differentiae notated on the staff. When these could be matched to tonary letters through reference to the manuscript tonary, the appropriate letters have been supplied in the computer index.Ff. 199-204 in Graz 29 are the work of a different text hand inserted, out of liturgical order, before the Sanctorale section of the manuscript (Andrew, 205r). Therefore, the group of folios that precedes them (ff. 187-198, containing polyphonic settings of the Solemn Readings for Christmas) may also have been added to the manuscript at a later date, between the Temporale and Sanctorale sections. The hand of these folios containing polyphony, however, is more similar to the main body of the manuscript. The ends of both manuscripts appear to include a few folios appended at a later date.The two volumes overlap in interesting ways. Although only slightly longer, Graz 29 contains some unusual items (tones for the Lamentations of Jeremiah, 168v; the Office of the Dead, 352v; the Invitatory Tones, 363v; the Tonary, 377r; Polyphonic Settings, 187r and 379r) which are not included in Graz 30. By contrast, Graz 30 contains the majority of the important occasions of the Sanctorale. Both manuscripts include the Commons, a fortunate duplication because a folio lost in the Common of Virgins in Graz 30 (between ff. 369 and 370) may be reconstructed from Graz 29, beginning on f. 346r.The Commons in Graz 30 were probably copied from Graz 29, judging by the stray rubric (&amp;ldquo;In commemoratione animarum fidelium&amp;rdquo;) added by the copyist at the bottom of f. 374v. In Graz 29, this rubric precedes the Office of the Dead, after the Commons, which the scribe evidently copied into Graz 30 before deciding not to include that Office in the second volume. It is uncertain how much time may have elapsed between the production of the two volumes, but there are a few differences between the two versions of the Commons.In addition, the end of the summer Sanctorale in Graz 30 (Saturninus, 324r; Andrew, 324v; Nicholas, 330v; the Octave of Andrew, 336v; and Damasus, 336v) overlaps the beginning of the Advent Sanctorale in Graz 29 (Andrew, 205r; Nicholas, 212r; the Octave of Andrew, 219r; and Damasus, 219r). Comparison of these sections of the two manuscripts reveals some interesting changes in the Abbey liturgy in the period between the production of the two volumes. The feast of Saturninus appears to have been added in this time; incipits for the Magnificat and Benedictus antiphons as found in Graz 30 (324r-v) have been added to Graz 29 in the top margin of f. 205r.An antiphon intended for a procession after Lauds on St. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Day (Graz 29, 211v) appears, by its absence from Graz 30 (330r), to have been removed from that function. The Benedictus antiphon selected for Damasus is different in Graz 29 and 30, although both are Common antiphons. The few minor variants which may be observed between versions of individual melodies in the two manuscripts (for example, the antiphon &amp;ldquo;Ambulans Jesus juxta mare&amp;rdquo;) suggest that the copyist of Graz 30 may have worked at least in part from memory rather than slavishly copying melodies from Graz 29 into Graz 30.&amp;nbsp;The Polyphony in Graz, Universitätsbibliothek, 29 and 30Graz 29 and 30 present the solemn record of a highly developed body of music for the Office as it was celebrated at the Austrian monastery of Sankt Lambrecht. Among the important aspects of the abbey&amp;rsquo;s musical sophistication, the large number of polyphonic pieces is perhaps the most obvious. Two thirds of this important repertory--approximately sixty hymns, conductus, responsory verses and doxologies--has already been indexed in Gilbert Reaney, ed., Repertoire International des Sources Musicales, series B, no. 4, Manuscripts of Polyphonic Music (c. 1320- 1400) (Munich: G. Henle Verlag, 1969), 2: 327-333. These items are listed in Tables I &amp; II. The other polyphonic settings in Graz 29 and Graz 30 have remained unknown. The opportunity afforded to CANTUS in compiling complete indices of these two manuscripts has made it possible to remedy this problem. Tables III &amp; IV list all polyphony--responsory verses and doxologies--not indexed by RISM.TABLE IPolyphonic Items in GRAZ 29 Catalogued in RISMFolio#FeastNameGenreIncipit187r01Nativitas DominiMGaudens in domino in hoc187v01Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri187v02Nativitas DominiLPrimo tempore alleviata est189v03Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri190r01Nativitas DominiLPrimo tempore alleviata est192r02Nativitas DominiMJube domne benedicere192r03Nativitas DominiLConsolamini consolamini194v01Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri194v02Nativitas DominiLConsurge consurge induere197r03Nativitas DominiMJube domne silentium fieri197r04Nativitas DominiLSalvator noster dilectissimi202v01AgnetisVGloria patri et filio et203r01AgnetisVGloria patri et filio et289v01GregoriiVA domino factum est istud et289v02GregoriiVGloria patri et filio et291r02GregoriiVMemor esto congregationis291r03GregoriiVGloria patri et filio et293v01BenedictiVGloria patri et filio et293v02BenedictiIUt Christo celebri jubilemus [Intonation only]297r01BenedictiVPer te ducem clarissimum ut297r02BenedictiVGloria patri et filio et301r01Annuntiatio MariaeVO sancta et benedicta o301v01Annuntiatio MariaeVGloria patri et filio et303v01Annuntiatio MariaeVQuoniam peccatorum mole303v02Annuntiatio MariaeVGloria patri et filio et305v01Annuntiatio MariaeVGloria patri parilique proli379r01HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerum379r02HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerum379v01HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerum379v02HymniHTe lucis ante terminum rerumTABLE IIPolyphonic Items in GRAZ 30 Catalogued in RISMFolio#FeastNameGenreIncipit108r02In Dedicatione Eccl.VVidit Jacob in somnis scalam108v01In Dedicatione Eccl.VGloria patri et filio et112r02In Dedicatione Eccl.VGloria patri et filio et172r01Transl.

VirginumVGloria patri et filio etThe polyphonic item in Graz 29 &amp;ldquo;Constantes estote videbitis&amp;rdquo; was added by a later hand in the lower margin of f. 37v, where the original monophonic melodies of both verse and doxology found in the main body of the page reappear with discant voices added to them. Four small staves have been added to accommodate this musical material. This item may have been excluded from the list of polyphonic items in RISM because it was a later addition to the manuscript; yet the verse &amp;ldquo;Per te ducem&amp;rdquo; for Benedict&amp;rsquo;s Translation [Graz 30, 172r] was included there even though its polyphonic version appears on an added half-folio inserted into the manuscript.In Graz 30 the polyphony not listed in RISM is disguised by the fact that the added voices were written in the lower margin of the page rather than next to the chants. The discants for the two verses for the Nativity of Mary [247r, 249r] were added in the lower margin in a text hand and musical notation similar to those of the original body of the manuscript. In the remaining five added discants, the text hand is similar to that of the original script but the staff notation is of a later type. In all five cases, the voice added to the doxology was notated in the lower margin of the preceding folio. In two cases [334r, 357r] doxologies with discant were added on two staves for responsories that did not originally include doxologies.There is some consistency in the liturgical assignment of responsory verses for which polyphony is supplied. With one exception, each of the final responsories for Matins in the Commons of Graz 30 has a polyphonic verse; the exception is the Common of Apostles. (The Commons in Graz 29, in most respects quite similar to those of Graz 30, lack the added voice parts.) The non-standard verse melodies are the same in both manuscripts [in Graz 29, &amp;ldquo;Tradiderunt,&amp;rdquo; 322v; &amp;ldquo;Immortalis,&amp;rdquo; 332r; &amp;ldquo;Vigilate,&amp;rdquo; 340v; &amp;ldquo;Eructavit,&amp;rdquo; 350r]. Actually, the verse &amp;ldquo;Tradiderunt&amp;rdquo; is set to both non-standard and standard verse formulae in both manuscripts.A single musical style is common to all Sankt Lambrecht polyphony, both for those items included in the main body of the manuscript and the marginal items. A cantor familiar with the rules for producing this type of discant might have been able to improvise an accompaniment to a familiar melody, much as fauxbourdon was used to ornament a single line. In fact, the marginal discants in both manuscripts may be the results of-- or plans for--such improvisations. The fact that not all responsories include polyphonic intonations for the respond after the verse may reflect the relative ease with which a cantor could have improvised the discant part.The polyphonic musical style in these manuscripts is primarily homophonic with the discant matching the original melody neume for neume. This is true of the simplest items (such as the second &amp;ldquo;Jube domne silentium,&amp;rdquo; Graz 29, 189v, which is basically an ornamented recitation tone) as well as more melismatic pieces (such as &amp;ldquo;Per te ducem,&amp;rdquo; Graz 29, 297r, or Graz 30, 172r). A single pitch is occasionally held for the duration of several pitches in the opposite voice (see the first &amp;ldquo;Jube domne silentium,&amp;rdquo; Graz 29, 187v, the final neume of each strophe). Furthermore, this single pitch may be notated either as several repeated puncta or as a long (compare in the same piece the ending of the first and second strophes).The discant voice stays most commonly at the interval of a perfect fifth and progresses in parallel motion with the chant. In order to preserve the perfect fifth, E-flats are usually notated in the accompanying part when B-flats occur in the principal voice. In cases where there is contrary motion, perfect intervals (unison, fifth, octave, and the occasional fourth) are strictly maintained between the two voices. An exception is the occasional third that results from contrary motion in passing from a fifth to a unison, or vice versa. This rigorous maintenance of certain intervals occasionally produces discant lines that are rather disjunct (such as the opening of the discant for the verse &amp;ldquo;Inter choros confessorum&amp;rdquo; for Benedict, Graz 29, 293r).When other Austrian manuscripts are examined, the Sankt Lambrecht polyphony proves even more interesting. All responsory verses set polyphonically in Graz 29 and 30 involve non-standard melodies. Comparison of indices in the CANTUS database facilitates the study of these melodies, which are often part of numerical series (such as in the late Offices for Benedict or Gregory). Rather than being modal formulae, as are standard responsory verses, these melodies are individual compositions transmitted from source to source with few changes. Most of these special melodies have a rather wide geographical distribution, and many appear in the other Austrian sources indexed by CANTUS--Vorau 287 (from Salzburg) and Klosterneuburg 1017 and 1018 (from Klosterneuburg). The melodies for Commons responsory verses also appear in the Commons of both other sources either in Vespers or as supplemental Matins responsories. The musicians of Sankt Lambrecht sought to elaborate these special melodies even further by adding discant voices. The fourth melody for the hymn &amp;ldquo;Te lucis ante terminum&amp;rdquo; [Graz 29, 379v] has also been added to Vorau 287 for hymn texts for the feast of the Immaculate Conception (&amp;ldquo;Maria mater domini aeterni&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Maria virgo regia ex stirpe,&amp;rdquo; 311v) and for Anne (&amp;ldquo;Assunt Annae sollemnia,&amp;rdquo; 319r). The discant lines, however, appear to be unique to Sankt Lambrecht.</description>

    <description>An analysis of the contents of the volume shows a misordering of several folios. The correct order following the present numbering is: ff. 1-8, 14, 10-13, 9, 15-111, 119, 113-118, 112, 120-126.
The eight Klosterneuburg manuscripts 1013, 1012, 1010, 589, 1011, 1015, 1017, and 1018 were copied over a period spanning two centuries. Codices Claustroneoburgensis (CCl.) 1013, 1012 and 1010 are among the oldest surviving sources in the Klosterneuburg library of the sung Office liturgy. CCl. 1013 and 1012 can be paired to create a complete twelfth-century representation of the church year, since 1012 begins at Pentecost and 1013 ends just before. CCl. 589, 1011, 1015, 1017 and 1018 date from over a century later. Of these later manuscripts, three contain the chants of the pars hiemalis (winter) and two the pars aestiva (summer).&amp;nbsp;
	
	Several of the Offices found in these manuscripts but not included in CAO appear in full in Analecta hymnica (AH), as well as in other Cantus Database files. The Office for Immaculate Conception appears in AH vol. 5, pp. 47-50; Ursula appears in AH vol. 28, pp. 256-9; and Benedict in AH vol. 25, pp. 145-9.
	
	The differentiae for each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. These differentia codes are consistent throughout these eight Klosterneuburg inventories.
	
	The eight Klosterneuburg manuscripts are likely from the female side of the double house and reflect the particular liturgical practices of the women of Klosterneuburg, as discussed by Klugseder, Norton, and Carr.</description>

    <description>The eight manuscripts 1013, 1012, 1010, 589, 1011, 1015, 1017, and 1018 were copied over a period spanning two centuries. Codices Claustroneoburgensis (CCl.) 1013, 1012 and 1010 are among the oldest surviving sources in the Klosterneuburg library of the sung Office liturgy. CCl. 1013 and 1012 can be paired to create a complete twelfth-century representation of the church year, since 1012 begins at Pentecost and 1013 ends just before. CCl. 589, 1011, 1015, 1017 and 1018 date from over a century later. Of these later manuscripts, three contain the chants of the pars hiemalis (winter) and two the pars aestiva (summer).Several of the Offices found in these manuscripts but not included in CAO appear in full in Analecta hymnica (AH), as well as in other CANTUS files. The Office for Immaculate Conception appears in AH vol. 5, pp. 47-50; Ursula appears in AH vol. 28, pp. 256-9; and Benedict in AH vol. 25, pp. 145-9.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. These differentia codes are consistent throughout these eight Klosterneuburg indices.The eight Klosterneuburg manuscripts are likely from the female side of the double house and reflect the particular liturgical practices of the women of Klosterneuburg, as discussed by Klugseder, Norton, and Carr.</description>

CCl. 589, 1011, 1015, 1017 and 1018 date from over a century later. Of these later manuscripts, three contain the chants of the pars hiemalis (winter) and two the pars aestiva (summer).Several of the Offices found in these manuscripts but not included in CAO appear in full in Analecta hymnica (AH), as well as in other CANTUS files. The Office for Immaculate Conception appears in AH vol. 5, pp. 47-50; Ursula appears in AH vol. 28, pp. 256-9; and Benedict in AH vol. 25, pp. 145-9.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. These differentia codes are consistent throughout these eight Klosterneuburg indices.The eight Klosterneuburg manuscripts are likely from the female side of the double house and reflect the particular liturgical practices of the women of Klosterneuburg, as discussed by Klugseder, Norton, and Carr.</description>

    <liturgical_occasions>Ff. 1-63: Temporale and Sanctorale. 1r, first Sunday of Advent; 2r, Nicholas; 4r, Lucy; 4, Great “O” antiphons; 9v, Christmas; 14r, per annum; 15v, Fabian and Sebastian; 17v, Agnes; 19r, Conversion of Paul; 19r, Purification; 20r, Septuagesima; 21r, First Sunday of Lent; 27v, Easter; 38r, Philip and James; 38v, Finding of the Cross; 41v, Ascension; 43r, Pentecost; 45r, Trinity Sunday; 46r, John the Baptist; 47r, Peter and Paul; 48r, Margaret; 49v, Mary Magdalene; 50v Peter’s Chains; 51r, Finding of Stephen; 52r, Afra; 53r, Laurence; 55r, Hippolytus; 55v, Assumption; 56v, Augustine; 57r, Exaltation of the Cross; 57v, Matthew; 58r, Commune; 60r, Histories.</liturgical_occasions>
    <description>The fragmentary nature of these leaves has resulted in numerous lacunae: after ff. 1v, 2v, 3v, 11v, 12v, 13v, 14v, 18v, 19v, 20v, 21v, 22v, 23v, 35v, 36v, 37v, 41v, 43v, 45v, 46v, 47v, 49v, 51v, 55v, 56v, 57v, 58v, 59v, and 61v. Several important liturgical occasions are missing, including Epiphany and Palm Sunday. Many of the extant leaves have been cropped, so that significant portions of their contents are missing. These include: 2r, 2v, 21r, 21v, 23r, 23v, 32r, 32v, 36r, 36v, 37r, 37v, 38r, 38v, 40r, 40v, 42r, 42v, 44r, 44v, 47r, 47v, 52r, 52v, 53r, 53v. In most of these instances, enough of the original chant is visible in order to identify the text. In addition, a number of folios are very badly damaged and not all their texts can be positively identified. These include: 1w, 1x, 4r, 5r, 10r, 10v, 11v, 15r, 16, 17r, 27r, 29v, 30r, 31v, 56r, 60r.Some differentiae and modal designations for antiphons are visible; these appear to survive from the earliest layer of scribal activity. When the modal number and/or the full differentia can be read clearly, these have been entered into the index. The cropping of many of the complete folios has resulted in incomplete differentiae in their margins and modal designations which have been obscured or eliminated. The differentiae are numbered arbitrarily for each mode.Modes for responsories are provisional; they are being proposed after an analysis of the neume forms of the responsory verses and a comparison of the modal designations of the various responsories in other sources in the database. This analysis has demonstrated that the standard verse tones are consistently represented within these leaves by neumes distinctive for each mode. Because of their provisional nature, all mode numbers for responsories in the index are followed by a question mark. Again, if there is any ambiguity (such as in cases where a non-standard tone is given for a verse or where the verse cannot be sufficiently read), a mode has not been assigned.&amp;nbsp;</description>

    <description>Linz 290 contains a monastic breviary from Kremsmünster. It dates from the twelfth century, with later additions. The additions are noteworthy, however; they include text and music for the Lamentations, as well as differentiae for Christmas, the Octave of Christmas, Epiphany, and Triduum. (Differentiae appear only for these Offices in the manuscript, and are numbered arbitrarily in the index.) The Offices for Mary Magdalene (thirteenth century) and Benedict are also later than the main body of the manuscript. The Benedict Office is a rhymed Office written over the earlier Office; the latter is included in an introduction to the published version of this index prepared by Martin Czernin but it is the later, rhymed Office which is in the CANTUS index as it is the one visible in the microfilm of the manuscript. Full texts for the Office are available in Analecta hymnica, vol. 25, pp. 145-9.Because the notation consists of non-diastematic neumes, mode is impossible to determine for antiphons; however, an attempt has been made to match the neumes given for responsory verses to the modal formulas for such chants, so mode is included for responsories whenever possible.&amp;nbsp;</description>

    <description>Although this manuscript is part of a collection of medieval music manuscripts held at the male Augustinian monastery of St. Florian, due to the inclusion of chants for Wolfgangus, Bishop of Regensburg, and similarities in its liturgical order with sources from the Diocese of Regensburg (e.g. London, British Library, printed book IB. 6753), Dobszay and Klugseder both suggest that the manuscript is from Regensburg. There is also some discrepancy over the date of the manuscript; the library catalogue for St. Florian places the manuscript in the fourteenth century, but Dobszay suggests that it is more likely from the thirteenth century. 

Throughout this manuscript, differentiae for antiphons are given in the margins, apparently in the original hands. These are often accompanied by modal designations in lower-case Roman numerals, also in the original hands. 

When the mode is not indicated, it can be determined if the exact neume forms of the differentia are given an explicit modal designation elsewhere in the manuscript. In such cases and others in which the mode is evident, but not given explicitly for the particular chant, the mode number is entered into the mode field, but followed by a question mark. If there is any ambiguity, a mode has not been assigned. Differentiae are numbered for each mode in no particular order. There is a series of differentiae for antiphons whose modes cannot be determined. These are characterized by having only a question mark in the mode column. Modes for responsories are provisional; they are based on the neume forms of the eight verse tones and comparison with the other sources in the database. Because of their provisional nature, all mode numbers for responsories are followed by a question mark. Again, if there is any ambiguity (such as in cases where a non-standard tone is given for a verse), a mode has not been assigned.</description>

    <description>The texts of a number of unusual Offices not recorded in Hesbert&amp;#39;s Corpus Antiphonalium Officii have already been edited in Analecta Hymnica: Dorothy (vol. 5, 56); Margaret (vol. 28, 3); Eustace (vol. 26, 15); Elizabeth of Hungary (vol. 25, 90); Catherine (vol. 26, 69); Martha (vol. 28, 45); Barbara (vol. 25, 121); Immaculate Conception (vol. 5, 47); Juliana (vol. 26, 184); Anne (vol. 5, 110); Holy Lance (vol. 5, 35); Acacius and Companions (vol. 5, 91). Many texts are not included in Analecta Hymnica, including Corpus Christi (the version attributed to Thomas Aquinas), Augustine, the Beheading of John the Baptist, the 11,000 Virgins, and Thomas the Apostle. Of these five Offices, only that for Corpus Christi may be found in Hughes, LMLO.Two special items in the manuscript are of interest but were not indexed in our file: the tonary, with antiphons whose melismas outline each of the eight modes (ff. 285v-286v); canticle tones which have been notated to the first verse of both Magnificat and Benedictus canticles, in all eight modes (ff. 286v-288r).In addition to Mass Alleluias in second Vespers in Easter week, the manuscript includes Alleluias for Barbara (304v01), Immaculate Conception (310v02), Anne (320r01), and Acacius and Companions (336r03). That for Barbara (&quot;Alleluia O beata Barbara deo&quot;) was transcribed from Vorau 287 in Karlheinz Schlager, ed., Alleluia-Melodien, 2 vols., Monumenta Monodica Medii Aevi 7-8 (Kassel: Baerenreiter, 1968, 1987), 2: 301. There are also three sequences, for Immaculate Conception (&quot;O consolatrix pauperum,&quot; 310v03), Anne (&quot;Caeli regem attollamus,&quot; 319v01), and a non-specific Marian sequence (&quot;Gaude virgo gratiosa&quot;, 320v06).Some paleographical details of the manuscript posed problems for the indexers. The numerous errors of the text scribe--insertions, omissions, wrong words--have been carefully corrected in marginal and interlinear annotations, apparently by the music scribe. In cases that affected the incipit to be recorded in the file, the text was always entered with these corrections. The system of differentiae also appears to have been implemented by at least two scribes, either contemporaneously or at different times. Nearly all differentiae listed in the tonary occur throughout the manuscript in two to five variations (some are found only in the tonary). Two-digit differentia numbers reflect this problem: an Arabic number indicates the basic differentia with a lower case letter for the variation (if no variation was observed, only an Arabic number was used).</description>

    <description>These late-fifteenth- or early-sixteenth-century manuscripts are from the Vienna Dompropstei Kirnberg an der Mank, in lower Austria.&amp;nbsp; In 1981, the library was moved to the Diocesan Archive in Vienna, and has been accessible there since 1992.&amp;nbsp; Together these sources form a three-volume antiphoner that preserves the complete Office as it was practiced most probably at the former collegiate chapter of St. Pancras in Kirnberg.&amp;nbsp; This chapter was founded in 1483 and incorporated in 1613 into St. Stephen&amp;rsquo;s of Vienna, under Melchior Klesl.C-11 and C-10 contain the Matins and Lauds for winter and summer respectively, while D-4 records mainly the Vespers Offices for the entire liturgical year.&amp;nbsp; Although C-11 is arranged in liturgical order, the sanctorale in C-10 is not; moreover, many saints&amp;#39; Offices in C-10 are split: after the chants for Matins, a cue indicates where the antiphons for Lauds may be found later in the manuscript.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the repeated Common of Saints in C-11 and C-10 and some other overlaps, there are numerous cross-references between the volumes.&amp;nbsp; [See the Addendum field for indications of these overlaps for chants which are not included in CAO.]&amp;nbsp; There are eleven lines on each side of Laon-Gothic notation on four-line staves with F and C clefs.&amp;nbsp; The liturgy follows the diocesan Office of Passau.Owing to their late date, C-11, C-10 and D-4 contain many Offices not surveyed in CAO.&amp;nbsp; Some of these are edited in Analecta hymnica:&amp;nbsp; the Holy Lance (vol. 5, pp. 35-6); Dorothy (vol. 5, pp.163-5); Kunegunde (vol. 26, pp. 224-7); Servatius (vol. 5, pp. 214-6); Acacius (vol. 5, pp. 91-3); Visitation (vol. 24, pp. 89-91); Margaret (vol. 28, pp. 17-20); James (vol. 26, pp. 124-6); Anna (vol. 5, pp. 110-2); Aegidius (vol. 25, pp. 22-4); Jerome (vol. 26, pp. 105-7); Francis of Assisi (vol. 5, pp. 175-9); Coloman (vol. 13, pp. 95-8); Hedwig (vol. 26, pp. 79-83); Martha (vol. 28, pp. 45-7); Ursula (vol. 5, pp. 238-41); Elizabeth (vol. 25, pp. 253-8); Presentation (vol. 24, pp. 76-80); Catherine (vol. 26, pp. 197-204); Barbara (vol. 25, pp. 116-21); Conception (vol. 5, pp. 47-50); Judocus (vol. 26, pp. 142-6) and Thomas Becket (vol. 13, pp. 238-42).The dates for several of the liturgical occasions in the Kirnberg manuscripts are known to have differed from the standard dates in the CANTUS table of liturgical occasions owing to local traditions within the Diocese of Passau.&amp;nbsp; Although the &quot;liturgical occasion codes&quot; have been entered into the indices in order that searches or comparisons on that field will return the appropriate data, the local feast dates are provided here:Severinus - Jan. 4 (not Jan. 5)Godehard - May 4 (not May 5)Hedwig - Oct. 15 (not Oct. 16)Martha - Oct. 17 (not July 29)Margaret - July 12 (not July 20)Transfiguration - Aug. 26 (not Aug. 6)Musical items of note include:the prosulae &quot;Missus ab arce veniebat/Gloria pie trinitati&quot; and &quot;Quem aethera et terra&quot; for the Christmas responsories &quot;Descendit de caelis&quot; and &quot;Verbum caro factum est&quot; respectively (C-11, D-4) and &quot;Omnibus firmiter credentibus&quot; for the Corpus Christi responsory &quot;Homo quidam fecit cenam&quot; (D-4);tones for the Exsultet, Invitatories, Lamentations and the Te Deum (D-4);Mass chants for the Holy Lance with the sequence &quot;Hodierne festum lucis&quot; (Analecta hymnica vol. 54, pp. 211-2), Mary of the Snows, and the sequence &quot;In Wolfgangi canamus&quot; (Analecta hymnica vol. 55, pp. 387-8) for the Translation of Wolfgang (C-10);the Vespers Hymn &quot;Florem mirificum&quot; (Analecta hymnica vol. 4, pp. 261-2) for Wolfgang (C-10).Differentiae are identified by a combination of letters and numbers: the letter indicates the final note of the differentia, and the number is assigned to distinguish between differentiae with the same final within each mode; the same system identifies differentiae in all three indices.&amp;nbsp; Chants overlapped between the sources have been cross-referenced by adding &quot;C-11&quot;, &quot;C-10&quot;, and/or &quot;D-4&quot; in the &quot;Addendum&quot; field.</description>

    <description>These late-fifteenth- or early-sixteenth-century manuscripts are from the Vienna Dompropstei Kirnberg an der Mank, in lower Austria.&amp;nbsp; In 1981, the library was moved to the Diocesan Archive in Vienna, and has been accessible there since 1992.&amp;nbsp; Together these sources form a three-volume antiphoner that preserves the complete Office as it was practiced most probably at the former collegiate chapter of St. Pancras in Kirnberg.&amp;nbsp; This chapter was founded in 1483 and incorporated in 1613 into St. Stephen&amp;rsquo;s of Vienna, under Melchior Klesl.C-11 and C-10 contain the Matins and Lauds for winter and summer respectively, while D-4 records mainly the Vespers Offices for the entire liturgical year.&amp;nbsp; Although C-11 is arranged in liturgical order, the sanctorale in C-10 is not; moreover, many saints&amp;#39; Offices in C-10 are split: after the chants for Matins, a cue indicates where the antiphons for Lauds may be found later in the manuscript.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the repeated Common of Saints in C-11 and C-10 and some other overlaps, there are numerous cross-references between the volumes.&amp;nbsp; [See the Addendum field for indications of these overlaps for chants which are not included in CAO.]&amp;nbsp; There are eleven lines on each side of Laon-Gothic notation on four-line staves with F and C clefs.&amp;nbsp; The liturgy follows the diocesan Office of Passau.Owing to their late date, C-11, C-10 and D-4 contain many Offices not surveyed in CAO.&amp;nbsp; Some of these are edited in Analecta hymnica:&amp;nbsp; the Holy Lance (vol. 5, pp. 35-6); Dorothy (vol. 5, pp.163-5); Kunegunde (vol. 26, pp. 224-7); Servatius (vol. 5, pp. 214-6); Acacius (vol. 5, pp. 91-3); Visitation (vol. 24, pp. 89-91); Margaret (vol. 28, pp. 17-20); James (vol. 26, pp. 124-6); Anna (vol. 5, pp. 110-2); Aegidius (vol. 25, pp. 22-4); Jerome (vol. 26, pp. 105-7); Francis of Assisi (vol. 5, pp. 175-9); Coloman (vol. 13, pp. 95-8); Hedwig (vol. 26, pp. 79-83); Martha (vol. 28, pp. 45-7); Ursula (vol. 5, pp. 238-41); Elizabeth (vol. 25, pp. 253-8); Presentation (vol. 24, pp. 76-80); Catherine (vol. 26, pp. 197-204); Barbara (vol. 25, pp. 116-21); Conception (vol. 5, pp. 47-50); Judocus (vol. 26, pp. 142-6) and Thomas Becket (vol. 13, pp. 238-42).The dates for several of the liturgical occasions in the Kirnberg manuscripts are known to have differed from the standard dates in the CANTUS table of liturgical occasions owing to local traditions within the Diocese of Passau.&amp;nbsp; Although the &quot;liturgical occasion codes&quot; have been entered into the indices in order that searches or comparisons on that field will return the appropriate data, the local feast dates are provided here:Severinus - Jan. 4 (not Jan. 5)Godehard - May 4 (not May 5)Hedwig - Oct. 15 (not Oct. 16)Martha - Oct. 17 (not July 29)Margaret - July 12 (not July 20)Transfiguration - Aug. 26 (not Aug. 6)Musical items of note include:the prosulae &quot;Missus ab arce veniebat/Gloria pie trinitati&quot; and &quot;Quem aethera et terra&quot; for the Christmas responsories &quot;Descendit de caelis&quot; and &quot;Verbum caro factum est&quot; respectively (C-11, D-4) and &quot;Omnibus firmiter credentibus&quot; for the Corpus Christi responsory &quot;Homo quidam fecit cenam&quot; (D-4);tones for the Exsultet, Invitatories, Lamentations and the Te Deum (D-4);Mass chants for the Holy Lance with the sequence &quot;Hodierne festum lucis&quot; (Analecta hymnica vol. 54, pp. 211-2), Mary of the Snows, and the sequence &quot;In Wolfgangi canamus&quot; (Analecta hymnica vol. 55, pp. 387-8) for the Translation of Wolfgang (C-10);the Vespers Hymn &quot;Florem mirificum&quot; (Analecta hymnica vol. 4, pp. 261-2) for Wolfgang (C-10).Differentiae are identified by a combination of letters and numbers: the letter indicates the final note of the differentia, and the number is assigned to distinguish between differentiae with the same final within each mode; the same system identifies differentiae in all three indices.&amp;nbsp; Chants overlapped between the sources have been cross-referenced by adding &quot;C-11&quot;, &quot;C-10&quot;, and/or &quot;D-4&quot; in the &quot;Addendum&quot; field.</description>
    <indexing_notes>The indices were prepared by Lap Kwan Kam (Universität Wien, for C-11, D-4 and the revision of C-10).  Editorial assistance was provided by Debra Lacoste (University of Western Ontario, for D-4 and the revision of C-11 and C-10).</indexing_notes>

    <description>H.J. Hermann suggests that this brevarium may be from the male Benedictine abbey of St. Ulrich and St. Afra in Augsburg, due to the inclusion of the feasts for Scholastica (ff. 90r–91r); Benedict (ff. 98r–101r); Ulric, Bishop of Augsburg (ff. 232r–233v); and Afra (ff. 246r–250f). The abbey of St. Ulrich and St. Afra was formed in the early eleventh century and dissolved during the secularisation of Bavaria in 1802–1803. Robert Klugseder, however, identifies several flaws with this provenance of the manuscript, and places it instead at the male Benedictine abbey of Mondsee in Upper Austria. 

Manuscript is written on parchment with a smooth brown leather cover over beech wood added around the fifteenth century. Folios are numbered in pencil in upper right-hand corner of recto side and lower left-hand corner of the verso side. Differentiae are written in the margins of the manuscript.</description>

    <description>The explicit of this book indicates that the vesperale was revised by Magister Sixtus Haug [magistri Sixti Haugem revisum et emendatum] and that it was printed in 1495 on February 23 [vii. kal. Martii]. On the verso of the folio before the chants begin, there is a handwritten inscription, &amp;ldquo;Schloss Radegg.&amp;rdquo; This book is listed in the RELICS database, where other extant copies are listed (in RELICS, search under the phrase &amp;ldquo;Antiphonarium Augustense&amp;rdquo;). Although the book contains mostly chants for the Offices of First and Second Vespers, there are full Offices for Christmas, the Triduum, Easter and Corpus Christi. In cases where the book does not indicate (and context does not clearly suggest) whether a chant belongs to First or Second Vespers, only &amp;ldquo;V&amp;rdquo; is marked in the Office field. The foliation used in this inventory is that found in the book. As well as the single unnumbered folio at the beginning of the book, there is an unnumbered folio at the end containing Ratdolt&amp;rsquo;s device (that is, his trademark) on its verso side.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-character system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral.
In the invitatorale section of the book, the invitatory antiphon for Corpus Christi (Christum regem adoremus) is paired with the invitatory tone NE. However earlier in the Office of Corpus Christi, the incipit resembles the incipit for the tone CH. This latter tone is often associated in Office books with a particular antiphon melody used in the Christmas season (see Liber Usualis, p. 368ff), not the melody used for Christum regem in this book. Therefore the provisional code GR will be used for the tone incipit in the Corpus Christi Office. GR has this incipit in other sources of the Cantus Database, such as the Klosterneuburg manuscripts, for example.</description>

    <summary>Antiphoner. Possibly prepared for a Franciscan house in Spain. Square notation on red five-line staves. Secular cursus. 56 x 40 x 12cm. 222 folios, one lacuna. Page size approx. 51 x 37 cm. 6 staves per page, staff height approx. 44mm high. Regular gathering structure: 27 quaternions, 1 final ternion. 
(Formerly catalogued as AUS-Sfl Add.Ms.Fol.1.)</summary>
    <description>Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner’s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. 
 
The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    <summary>Compendium of offices and masses for Mary, Jerome, Pentecost, and Holy Week, among others, on vellum dating from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Square and mensural notation on red, 5-line staves, several hands. 121 leaves, bound, 53.5 x 35.5 cm, plus writing template 42 x 23.5 cm. Likely for a Hieronymite order of nuns, given the dedication to the "female religious of this house" and multiple rubrics that reference "our father, St. Jerome."</summary>
    <liturgical_occasions>Ff. 1r-40r, Vespers and Masses for Mary: 1v, Purification; 9r, Annunciation; 15v, Visitation (Vespers only); 17v, Our Lady of Snows; 20r, Assumption; 25v, Nativity of Mary; 31r, Presentation of Mary; 31v, Conception of Mary; 31v, Expectation of Mary; 35r, Marian Votive Masses; 39v, Holy Name of Mary (Mass only). Ff. 41r-48r: 41r, John the Baptist (Vespers, Mass); 46v, Jerome (Mass). See the description below for further detail regarding the subsequent sections of the manuscript, currently unindexed in Cantus.</liturgical_occasions>
    <description>The manuscript includes eight liturgical sections, beginning with what appears to be the original volume (ff. 1r-48r) and followed by an assemblage from other related manuscripts. The first section is dedicated by a devotee of Mary to a female religious house. Given the reverence for Mary stated in the dedication, it is not surprising that this first section primarily includes chants for Mary, with further feasts for John the Baptist (41r) and Jerome (46v). Examination of the contents suggests three feasts worthy of attention given the rarity of either the feast itself or the chants therein: Expectationis BVM, Presentatio Mariae, and Mariae ad Nives, each found in less than ten percent of Cantus sources. Because this first section of the manuscript reflects the original volume, this is the only section  currently indexed in Cantus (June 2018). 

Although the subsequent sections of the manuscript are unnumbered and comprise an unusual assortment of liturgical occasions, there is a recurring emphasis on Jerome amid various other chants: Matins Responsories for Jerome (Sept 30); Sundays 15-20 after Pentecost; Holy Week; Paula the widow (January 26); a Kyriale with four complete mass ordinary cycles; Apparition of James (May 23); and a final section for Jerome with more office chants. Of these seven sections, three bear a connection to Jerome, considering that the manuscript identifies Paula the widow as a follower of Jerome in the rubric for her feast. Among these feasts connected to Jerome, the office for Paula the widow (Vespers, Lauds, 10 chants in total) appears to be rare. There are, at the time of indexing, no other offices for her in Cantus, and only a few of the chants occur in other sources within the context of other feasts (see “Surrexerunt filii”, Can 205661, for St. Anne and “Domine dilexi decorem", Can 2341, for the Dedication of a Church). The Mass for the Apparition of James also appears unique within Cantus sources, although this bears revisiting given that the indexing of Mass chants in Cantus is relatively recent.

A further unifying feature of the compendium is the use of two related manuscripts (seemingly by the same scribe) to begin and end the volume. Both the first Marian section and final Jerome section exhibit the same scribal hand, but the final section is clearly from a smaller volume, with smaller folio size and only six (rather than seven) systems per folio. Although the other sections of the manuscript show different degrees of scribal variance, these also imitate, in part, the original section of the manuscript, using similarly shaped, sized, and coloured letter forms to begin certain chants.</description>

    <description>Les Sources describes the notation as aquitaine.  While a certain quality of stacking is present as in Aquitanian notation, other features point to the Rhein-Maas area, or at least toward northern France, particularly the messine stroke before a single note.  Thus the l (for Loraine) in the ms type.  The presence of feast of transfiguration also echoes the RM tradition around this period.  The final folios are very difficult to read on film.  Other added sequences may be burried in these folios.</description>

    <summary>Twelfth-century parchment manuscript sent from Hildegard of Bingen’s Rupertsberg monastery to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium in 1176. Early German staff notation in a Hufnagel style on 4-line staves, with red F-line and yellow C-line. 173 folios. 18 folios (f. 153–170v) with music notation. Last 3 fascicles (ff. 153–173) no longer attached. One folio missing between ff. 155 and 156 and another between ff. 164 and 165. 19.7 x 28.8 cms with a principal writing space of 15 x 24 cms.</summary>

    <description>The Dendermonde codex contains works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) and Elisabeth of Schönau (1129-1165), as well as one anonymous work: Liber Vitae Meritorum S. Hildegardis (ff. 1–121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121–152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153–170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170–173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is indexed in Cantus. 

Hildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.

The Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner’s mark on f. 173v, “Liber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari” (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point “Monasterii Haffligemensis” was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters &amp; Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and “M.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS” was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.</description>
    <indexing_notes>The inventory for B-DEa 9 was completed by Jennifer Bain and Nan Zhang (Dalhousie University). Full texts were entered by Nan Zhang and edited by Alessandra Ignesti (McGill University), with the "MS Reading" full texts being added by Alessandra Ignesti. Clare Neil (Dalhousie University) entered the melodies in Volpiano, and Clare Neil and Barbara Swanson proofread them.

    <summary>Twelfth-century parchment manuscript sent from Hildegard of Bingen’s Rupertsberg monastery to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium in 1176. Early German staff notation in a Hufnagel style on 4-line staves, with red F-line and yellow C-line. 173 folios. 18 folios (f. 153–170v) with music notation. Last 3 fascicles (ff. 153–173) no longer attached. One folio missing between ff. 155 and 156 and another between ff. 164 and 165. 19.7 x 28.8 cms with a principal writing space of 15 x 24 cms.</summary>

    <description>The Dendermonde codex contains works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) and Elisabeth of Schönau (1129-1165), as well as one anonymous work: Liber Vitae Meritorum S. Hildegardis (ff. 1–121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121–152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153–170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170–173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is indexed in Cantus. 

Hildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.

The Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner’s mark on f. 173v, “Liber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari” (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point “Monasterii Haffligemensis” was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters &amp; Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and “M.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS” was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.</description>

    <description>Tongeren (close to Maastricht and Aachen) was an episcopal see until the 4th century, when the see was moved to Maastricht, probably under Bishop Servatius.&amp;nbsp; In the 7th century it was moved to Liège.The two volumes were written in the same hand and are largely identical in terms of content; they were perhaps intended for use by opposite sides of the choir.In the ferial Office, there are a number of antiphons which end on the reciting tone of the psalm, as indicated in the differentia.&amp;nbsp; For these antiphons, the letter-name of the final is included in the second column of the mode field.&amp;nbsp; The mode number given in the first column is that associated with the differentia elsewhere in the manuscript.Full invitatory tones are only found in the Invitatoriale of MS 63.&amp;nbsp; Elsewhere in the manuscripts, only incipits of tones are indicated, as is the standard practice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The incipits for CH and GR are identical.&amp;nbsp; Throughout the indices of Tongeren 63 and 64, this incipit has been labelled CH when found with invitatory antiphons whose first musical phrase is the same as the end of the CH tone (i.e. only the antiphons used during Christmas and Epiphany, cao1055 and cao1054).&amp;nbsp; All other instances of this incipit have been labelled GR.All chants not found in CAO have been assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by "ton". &amp;nbsp;Any non-CAO chants also found in Den Hagg, Koninklijke Bibliotheek, 70 E 4 Fragmenta Tungrensiaare given the same identification numbers in the Tongres files, since these manuscripts all represent the liturgy of the same church. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, the differentia codes used for Den Haag are consistent with those of the Tongres 63 and 64; the differentiae are labelled with a letter-number combination (the letter indicates the final pitch of the differentia, and the number is arbitrarily assigned).For the most part, marginalia in later hands have not been entered into the indices.&amp;nbsp; However, included are a few additions in hands approximating the gothic style of the original layer of scribal activity.&amp;nbsp; Such entries are marked in the “Marginalia” column according to the guidelines specified in the File Description.</description>

    <description>Tongeren (close to Maastricht and Aachen) was an episcopal see until the 4th century, when the see was moved to Maastricht, probably under Bishop Servatius.&amp;nbsp; In the 7th century it was moved to Liège.The two volumes were written in the same hand and are largely identical in terms of content; they were perhaps intended for use by opposite sides of the choir.In the ferial Office, there are a number of antiphons which end on the reciting tone of the psalm, as indicated in the differentia.&amp;nbsp; For these antiphons, the letter-name of the final is included in the second column of the mode field.&amp;nbsp; The mode number given in the first column is that associated with the differentia elsewhere in the manuscript.Full invitatory tones are only found in the Invitatoriale of MS 63.&amp;nbsp; Elsewhere in the manuscripts, only incipits of tones are indicated, as is the standard practice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The incipits for CH and GR are identical.&amp;nbsp; Throughout the indices of Tongeren 63 and 64, this incipit has been labelled CH when found with invitatory antiphons whose first musical phrase is the same as the end of the CH tone (i.e. only the antiphons used during Christmas and Epiphany, cao1055 and cao1054).&amp;nbsp; All other instances of this incipit have been labelled GR.Any non-CAO chants also found in Den Hagg, Koninklijke Bibliotheek, 70 E 4 Fragmenta Tungrensia are given the same identification numbers in the Tongres files, since these manuscripts all represent the liturgy of the same church. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, the differentia codes used for Den Haag are consistent with those of the Tongres 63 and 64; the differentiae are labelled with a letter-number combination (the letter indicates the final pitch of the differentia, and the number is arbitrarily assigned).For the most part, marginalia in later hands have not been entered into the indices.&amp;nbsp; However, included are a few additions in hands approximating the gothic style of the original layer of scribal activity.&amp;nbsp; Such entries are marked in the &amp;ldquo;Marginalia&amp;rdquo; field.</description>

    <description>The colophon on f. 40v in Volume II reads: &amp;ldquo;Che libure feist faire Dame Julienne de glymes prieuse de Salsines Jadit grande chantre de ce lieu. Pryes dieu pour elle.&amp;rdquo; The date of 1554 appears on ff.122r and 197r in Volume I, and on f.16v in Volume II. The date of 1555 appears at the end of Volume I on f.197v and the end of Volume II on f.40v. According to the colophon the book was commissioned by Dame Julienne de Glymes, prioress and former cantrix of the Cistercian Abbey of Salzinnes, Namur, in present day Belgium, likely with parts of it completed in 1554 and the rest in 1555. Founded in 1196-97 by Philip the Noble Count of Namur, the Abbey was incorporated in the Cistercian Order in 1204 under the Diocese of Liège. It was destroyed by the French Revolutionary armies in 1795.The Salzinnes Antiphoner was likely acquired in the 1840s or 1850s in France by Bishop William Walsh, the first Archbishop for the Diocese of Halifax. It was donated to the Patrick Power Library, Saint Mary&amp;rsquo;s University by Archbishop James M. Hayes in 1975.Painted in a bright palette in gouache, the Salzinnes Antiphonal contains six full-page illuminations (Adoration of the Magi, Baptism of Christ, Agony in the Garden, Resurrection, Christ in Majesty, Holy Kinship) and six historiated initials (Annunciation, Adoration of the Shepherds and Saints George, Maurice, Hubert, and Juliana) and includes several scenes depicting multiple narratives from the Bible. The most significant feature of the Antiphonal is the full-length portraits of thirty-four nuns with their names in cursive and block script, some with patrons&amp;rsquo; coats-of-arms. In addition, three different religious orders are represented: Cistercians, Carmelites and Benedictines, in honour of the de Glymes family.</description>

    <description>The colophon on f. 40v in Volume II reads: &amp;ldquo;Che libure feist faire Dame Julienne de glymes prieuse de Salsines Jadit grande chantre de ce lieu. Pryes dieu pour elle.&amp;rdquo; The date of 1554 appears on ff.122r and 197r in Volume I, and on f.16v in Volume II. The date of 1555 appears at the end of Volume I on f.197v and the end of Volume II on f.40v. According to the colophon the book was commissioned by Dame Julienne de Glymes, prioress and former cantrix of the Cistercian Abbey of Salzinnes, Namur, in present day Belgium, likely with parts of it completed in 1554 and the rest in 1555. Founded in 1196-97 by Philip the Noble Count of Namur, the Abbey was incorporated in the Cistercian Order in 1204 under the Diocese of Liège. It was destroyed by the French Revolutionary armies in 1795.The Salzinnes Antiphoner was likely acquired in the 1840s or 1850s in France by Bishop William Walsh, the first Archbishop for the Diocese of Halifax. It was donated to the Patrick Power Library, Saint Mary&amp;rsquo;s University by Archbishop James M. Hayes in 1975.Painted in a bright palette in gouache, the Salzinnes Antiphonal contains six full-page illuminations (Adoration of the Magi, Baptism of Christ, Agony in the Garden, Resurrection, Christ in Majesty, Holy Kinship) and six historiated initials (Annunciation, Adoration of the Shepherds and Saints George, Maurice, Hubert, and Juliana) and includes several scenes depicting multiple narratives from the Bible. The most significant feature of the Antiphonal is the full-length portraits of thirty-four nuns with their names in cursive and block script, some with patrons&amp;rsquo; coats-of-arms. In addition, three different religious orders are represented: Cistercians, Carmelites and Benedictines, in honour of the de Glymes family.</description>

    <description>The colophon on f. 40v in Volume II reads: &amp;ldquo;Che libure feist faire Dame Julienne de glymes prieuse de Salsines Jadit grande chantre de ce lieu. Pryes dieu pour elle.&amp;rdquo; The date of 1554 appears on ff.122r and 197r in Volume I, and on f.16v in Volume II. The date of 1555 appears at the end of Volume I on f.197v and the end of Volume II on f.40v. According to the colophon the book was commissioned by Dame Julienne de Glymes, prioress and former cantrix of the Cistercian Abbey of Salzinnes, Namur, in present day Belgium, likely with parts of it completed in 1554 and the rest in 1555. Founded in 1196-97 by Philip the Noble Count of Namur, the Abbey was incorporated in the Cistercian Order in 1204 under the Diocese of Liège. It was destroyed by the French Revolutionary armies in 1795.The Salzinnes Antiphoner was likely acquired in the 1840s or 1850s in France by Bishop William Walsh, the first Archbishop for the Diocese of Halifax. It was donated to the Patrick Power Library, Saint Mary&amp;rsquo;s University by Archbishop James M. Hayes in 1975.Painted in a bright palette in gouache, the Salzinnes Antiphonal contains six full-page illuminations (Adoration of the Magi, Baptism of Christ, Agony in the Garden, Resurrection, Christ in Majesty, Holy Kinship) and six historiated initials (Annunciation, Adoration of the Shepherds and Saints George, Maurice, Hubert, and Juliana) and includes several scenes depicting multiple narratives from the Bible. The most significant feature of the Antiphonal is the full-length portraits of thirty-four nuns with their names in cursive and block script, some with patrons&amp;rsquo; coats-of-arms. In addition, three different religious orders are represented: Cistercians, Carmelites and Benedictines, in honour of the de Glymes family.</description>

    <summary>Sixteenth-century “mutilated” antiphoner, possibly from the Burgos monastery in Granada, Spain. Quadratic notation on five-line black staves. Monastic cursus. 97 extant folios. 55.6 x 38.7 cm. Nineteen lacunae</summary>

    <description>This choir book has been in the possession of the Music Library at The University of Western Ontario since the late 1960s, when it was purchased from a book-dealer in Paris. Apparently, this manuscript had been part of the collection at the Burgos monastery in Granada. Its prior whereabouts are unknown. There are no names, bookplates, stamps or other marks on the inside covers or elsewhere which might reveal any information about the provenance or the travels of this book prior to its present home. The only library identification marks are those of the University of Western Ontario; these are found on the inside front cover, as well as on the recto side of the first extant folio (fol. 27). The contents offer little insight as to where this volume was produced, used, or housed during the last few centuries.Of the original folios which may have numbered near 200, approximately half are extant. Many have been cut away at the spine and removed from the manuscript. The size of the principal writing-space is 43.8 x 27 cm; this is the interior dimension of the frame-ruling and does not include the liturgical-occasion headings which are written across the top of facing sides in red ink. The binding is original.This antiphoner contains the chants sung by the choir in the Offices of the Temporale surrounding Easter. The first extant folio gives a portion of the Offices for Maundy Thursday. It is reasonable to assume that the missing twenty-six folios at the beginning of the manuscript contained the chants for the six Sundays in Lent and the remainder of Holy Week. Chants for Good Friday (including the Lamentations of Jeremiah), Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday are followed by those for the weekdays after Easter and the ensuing Sundays in the paschal season. Offices for Ascension and Pentecost are followed by chants for Corpus Christi. A lacuna of ten folios before Corpus Christi most likely accounts for the absence of an Office for Trinity Sunday. Magnificat antiphons for the Sundays after Pentecost up to the month of August fill the last extant folios of this manuscript.&amp;nbsp;</description>

CXXXI, 1-6) One-line blue and red initials at the beginning of each paragraph. Nine-line large initial (M) in blue and red inks. Poor execution. On square ground, filled with red ink drawn straight lines; between its stems the initial contains acanthus leaves in blue ink, as well as limited branchwork extending through the upper part of the stems towards the top corners of the ground and ending in two rose buds. Two acanthus leaves are drawn below the lower part of the stems, half in blue and half in white, with brown lines drawn in the white section. A 012 mm., wide, margin bounds the square ground. It contains white curvilinear patterns, mostly in scroll form, created by the distribution of the red ink upon the margin's space.

    <summary>Miscellaneous choirbook from Northern Italy, made of 10 independent codicological units produced in different periods for a total of 143 un-numbered folios, with several lacunae. Written in various Gothic hands on vellum; square notation on red, 4-line staves. The surface of the leaves measures from 465 x 335 mm to 455 x 320 mm; the writing surface varies more widely according to the fragment. 
According to Seymour De Ricci, MS 73 was written in the 15th century, yet with all probability most of the quires were produced much earlier, between the late 13th century and the early 14th.

    <description>This manuscript consists of two parts. The first part (pp.1-428) is the oldest complete surviving Gradual with adiastematic neumes. Besides the Mass chants, in order throughout the liturgical year, there are appendices of Alleluia verses, hymns, antiphons for several occasions, and a neumed versicularium (Psalmi ad Communionem). The first page(s) are missing; the Gradual starts with the Alleluia Ostende nobis Domine of the 1st Sunday in Advent. In the Gradual, the Temporale and Sanctorale are not separated. Verses for the offertories are given with neumes. The Gradual section is known for the extraordinary usage of litterae significativae within the neume notation.

The second part of the codex (pp. 429-599) contains sequences by Notker from St. Gall (ca. 840-912); throughout this section the text forms the main body of each page with adiastematic neumes in the margins. 

The codex was written in Einsiedeln, likely for the third abbot of the cloister, Gregor the Englishman. Some chants are neumed by later hands. The pages of Einsiedeln 121 are numbered with a modern hand in black ink in the upper outside corners of the leaves (pp. 1-600); there is no original numbering. The manuscript includes various illuminated letters, mostly in the Gradual, and three large illustrations that cover the entire page: an ornamented monogram (p. 204: In die sancto Resurrectionis Domini ad Missam), the ornamented “Resurrexi” of Easter Sunday’s Introit (p. 205), and another ornamented monogram (p. 436: In nomine Domini incipit Lyber Ymnorum Notkeri).</description>

    <description>This manuscript consists of two parts. The first part (pp.1-428) is the oldest complete surviving Gradual with adiastematic neumes. Besides the Mass chants, in order throughout the liturgical year, there are appendices of Alleluia verses, hymns, antiphons for several occasions, and a neumed versicularium (Psalmi ad Communionem). The first page(s) are missing; the Gradual starts with the Alleluia Ostende nobis Domine of the 1st Sunday in Advent. In the Gradual, the Temporale and Sanctorale are not separated. Verses for the offertories are given with neumes. The Gradual section is known for the extraordinary usage of litterae significativae within the neume notation.

The second part of the codex (pp. 429-599) contains sequences by Notker from St. Gall (ca. 840-912); throughout this section the text forms the main body of each page with adiastematic neumes in the margins. 

The codex was written in Einsiedeln, likely for the third abbot of the cloister, Gregor the Englishman. Some chants are neumed by later hands. The pages of Einsiedeln 121 are numbered with a modern hand in black ink in the upper outside corners of the leaves (pp. 1-600); there is no original numbering. The manuscript includes various illuminated letters, mostly in the Gradual, and three large illustrations that cover the entire page: an ornamented monogram (p. 204: In die sancto Resurrectionis Domini ad Missam), the ornamented “Resurrexi” of Easter Sunday’s Introit (p. 205), and another ornamented monogram (p. 436: In nomine Domini incipit Lyber Ymnorum Notkeri).</description>

    <description>Einsiedeln 611 records a few examples of an unusual practice of the monks of Einsiedeln, the singing of some chants at Nones, prior to a feast's First Vespers, in anticipation of the days of certain important saints. Such services (consisting of an antiphon or an antiphon with versicle in the manuscript) may be observed for the following feasts: John the Baptist (f. 184v), Peter (f. 189r), Assumption (f. 213v), and All Saints (f. 237r). The fact that such a Nones service is included for the Common of Apostles (f. 251r) may indicate that this practice was more general than only for those occasions given specific chants for this service in the manuscript. It is not clear whether these anticipatory Nones services were conflated with or replaced the Nones service of the preceding day.Some of the unusual Offices in Einsiedeln 611 have been edited in Analecta Hymnica and also appear in Andrew Hughes's Late Medieval Liturgical Offices, including Catherine (AH vol. 26, p. 69, LMLO CB24) and the so-called "Historia nova" for Benedict (AH vol. 25, p. 52, LMLO BE01) that appears in Einsiedeln 611 on the feast of his translation. The prose Office for Corpus Christi (often attributed to Thomas Aquinas) was not edited in AHbut was copied in LMLO under the siglum XCX. These Offices appear in several other sources in the Cantus database.Other saints' Offices have not been edited in AH nor do they appear in LMLO. These include Meinrad, the hermit-founder of Einsiedeln (21 January); Sigismundus, martyred King of Burgundy (1 May); Felix and Regula, martyrs (11 September); and significant portions of the Office for Maurice and his companions (22 September).There are only three invitatory tones that are written out in Einsiedeln 611. Presumably there were others on folios now lost. The three tones are those identified as GR, 5, and 3 in the Cantus database. For some of the tones represented only by incipit there is little doubt as to their identity: 2, 7, NE, HS, and PA. One tone (beginning DA, GF, GF) seems likely to be BL; another incipit (DA, AC, A) appears to refer both to the tone in general use on Christmas (CH) and to the tone represented as GR in the database.A final tone seems to be one of those that was written on a leaf now missing from Hartker's antiphoner (St. Gall 390-391); its presence there can be inferred from a copy of Hartker (St. Gall 388) that includes it at the corresponding point in the series. It has been given the siglum HL. St. Gall 388 (and presumably Hartker) assign two antiphons to it, "Regem regum dominum" and "Surgite vigilemus." Einsiedeln 611 assigns the latter of these to the tone called 2 but assigns a second antiphon to this tone, "Ploremus coram domino," for the feast of Mary Magdalene.The differentiae for each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: a majuscule letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. For those differentiae that exist in slightly variant forms, minuscule letters (a-d) have been added as suffixes.</description>

    <description>The rubrics in this manuscript are based on those of the earliest Franciscan liturgy as edited by van Dijk in 1975, not, as indicated by Leisibach, those of the second Franciscan edition (edited by van Dijk in 1963). The manuscript was probably copied after 1260 since the first antiphon of Matins for the Office of Francis contains a wording ordered in a General Chapter of that year (statute edited in van Dijk, 1963, vol. 2, p. 420).The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary in terms only of immediately repeated notes, presence/absence of liquescence or neumation have been given the same differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter in the first column of the “Extra” field (see the File Description). Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by “fra.”The codes in this index for differentiae and chants not found in CAO are consistent with those used for the other Franciscan manuscripts in the database:Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 693Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 694Assisi, Cattedrale San Rufino - Archivio e Biblioteca, 5Budapest, Egyetemi Könyvtár (University Library), lat. 118, 119, 122, 121Chicago, Newberry Library, 24Città del Vaticano (Roma), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, lat. 8737München, Franziskanerkloster St. Anna - Bibliothek, 12o Cmm 1Napoli, Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III, vi.

    <description>At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France.</description>

    <description>Together with CH-SGs 391, this manuscript forms a complete antiphoner written and illuminated by the St. Gall monk Hartker in his recluse cell near St. Gall. He moved to the cell in 986 and stayed there until his death in 1011. 

The antiphoner was written for the male, Benedictine abbey of St. Gall, and is one of the earliest extant neumed antiphoners. The manuscripts are known for their script, neumes, and illuminations. Originally written as a single book, it was divided into two volumes in the mid-thirteenth century. Around this time, there were also some additions to the manuscript by another hand in Carolingian miniscule script (pp. 7-10).

This volume (390) contains chants from Advent until Easter, as well as a fragmented tonary. The tonary is divided between the Winter (390) and Summer (391) volumes and is missing some pages. Reconstructed in their original order, the tonary is as follows: pp. 1-2, 195-202 (1-8 of CH-SGs 391), 457-458 (263-264 of CH-SGs 391), 3-4, 193-194, 187-188, 455-456 (261-262 of CH-SGs 391), 5-6. An outline of the distribution of the tonary between the two volumes is handwritten on the inside fly-leaf of CH-SGs 390.

The manuscript includes a handwritten notes and a description of the antiphoner in Latin, written in two different hands on the inside front cover, and a stamp of the St. Gall coat of arms on p. 15. Tonary letters are written in the margins, and are transcribed in the differentia field of the index. Pages were numbered in pencil in the upper outside corners of the manuscript, after the division of the antiphoner into two volumes. The manuscript includes various illuminated letters and four coloured pen drawings: dedication of St. Gall receiving the book from Hartker (p. 11); St. Gregory with his dove dictating the chants to a scribe (p. 13); Last Supper (p. 183); and Christ washing St. Peter's feet (p. 186).</description>

    <summary>"Breviarium Strigoniense." Thirteenth-century breviary (including unnotated prayers, lessons, and other material between the chants). 328 folios. Two folios labelled f. 155. Two columns per folio side with a possible 20 staves or 38 lines of letters per page. An unknown number of leaves are missing at the beginning and end. The neumes were written by two main scribes with additions by several different hands. All scribes use Esztergom (Hungarian) neumes on a red, four-line staff. Short chants of a small range have one clef, c or f, while longer chants have two clefs, F-c, c-g, or B-F.</summary>
    <liturgical_occasions>Ff. 1r–328v, Temporale: f. 1r, Advent; f. 10r, Nativity; 21v, Stephen; 25v, John the Evangelist; f. 29v, Holy Innocents; f. 32v, Thomas Becket, Bishop of Canterbury; f. 47v, Votive Office for Mary, Christmas; f. 48r, Epiphany; f. 65r, Ferial Office; f. 89r, Septuagesima; f. 94v, Sexagesima; f. 100r, Quinquagesima; f. 104r, Lent; f. 152v, Holy Week; f. 163r, Easter; f. 197v, Pentecost; f. 208r, Trinity Sunday; 213v, Corpus Christi; f. 221r, Summer Histories.</liturgical_occasions>
    <description>Due to the secular cursus and the inclusion of liturgical aspects particular to Hungary (e.g., the responsorium prolixum Quam magnificata at second Vespers on Sundays per annum; the antiphon Ave spes  introducing second Vespers at Christmas; and the antiphona sola at Matins on the first three days of the Holy Week), the manuscript is of Hungarian diocesan provenance. More specifically, it is the earliest notated document of the Esztergom diocesan tradition. The writing technique in the manuscript also indicates that it was completed at the scriptorium of Esztergom.

It is unknown when and how the breviary arrived at the Strahovská knihovna of the Klášter premonstrátů na Strahovĕ, the library of the famous Premonstratensian monastery of Prague, but Janka Szendrei suggests that it was likely acquired sometime in the eighteenth century. 

The Sanctorale volume that would have accompanied this breviary is lost.

The manuscript is written on parchment. The manuscript was rebound in the nineteenth century at which point some of the margins were cut and ff. 10 and 15 were exchanged and turned upside down. Modern foliation in pencil in upper right-hand corner of the recto side of each folios was completed after rebinding with several errors. Several leaves have been bound upside down: for example, 10 and 15 have been switched in binding so that the folio numbered as “10” in the manuscript = 15 with respect to content in the index (and “10v” in the manuscript = 15r with respect to content in the index). “15r” in the manuscript = 10v, and “15v” = 10r. The items on these folia have been inventoried according to their current locations in order that users will be able to locate them in the online images (available in manuscriptorium.com).

The chant incipits have not been indexed from the long rubric on f. 3v.

Differentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number within each mode.

The majority of text is written in one hand with the exception of ff. 206r-222v, which was completed by another scribe and one or more notators at approximately the same time as the rest of the manuscript. It is Gothic textualis formata for the majority of the manuscript and rotunda-like script for ff. 206r-222v.</description>

    <description>It is quite clear that the monastery was under the influence of the Hirsau reform.  See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.
*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented – it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries – concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same époque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)
1. The breviary of Kunegunda of Kolovraty, a nun who commanded the manuscript between 1365 and 1385, shortly before she became abbess of the St. George Monastery. Shelfmark: Prague, Národní knihovna (National Library), XIII E 14a.

    <description>Quedlinburg was an important political and spiritual centre of Saxony in the tenth and eleventh centuries, closely associated with the Ottonian dynasty; it was likely both the place of origin and the intended destination of both the calendar and the antiphoner. These were likely copied between the years 1025 and 1070 (Möller, vol. 1, 32-8). Möller also suggests that these two documents could have been drafted independently of one another (ibid., 21). The original script of the antiphoner is supplemented by numerous marginal additions by later hands. These additions have been included in the index with identifiers in the &amp;ldquo;marginalia&amp;rdquo; field of the index (see the Widescreen File Description). In places where these additions are illegible in the facsimile, Möller&amp;rsquo;s transcriptions have been adopted in the index. Of particular interest are the chants for Godehard (77r, marginal), Servatius (079r, main text), the Translation of Justa (093r, marginal), the Translation of Servatius (93v, marginal), and the Passion of Laurentia (099v, marginal). Godehard was appointed bishop of Hildesheim (near Quedlinburg) by the Ottonian Henry II in the early eleventh century. The most prominent church in Quedlinburg is dedicated to Servatius, the first bishop of Tongeren, and his relics were translated to Quedlinburg from Maastricht (Servatius&amp;rsquo;s final resting place) in the tenth century (Zender, et al., p. 25 and Map 28). The identity of Justa in this manuscript is currently unknown. Relics of a &amp;ldquo;Jungfrau Laurentia&amp;rdquo; were obtained by King Otto I (912-973) during his exploits in Italy and brought to Quedlinburg (Schramm and Mütherich, p. 27), but whether this is the same person has not yet been substantiated. The rubric &quot;post b&quot; is found a number of times in the added marginalia of the Quedlinburg antiphoner, always preceding an antiphon, either at the end of Lauds or at the end of Vespers. The rubric is sometimes given as &quot;post benedicam&quot; (= post Benedicamus, top margin of folio 73r) or as a variant of &quot;post b Mag&quot; (folio 104r) or &quot;p Magnif.&quot; (folio 41v). Many of the antiphons indicated by these rubrics have the character of memorials. In addition to their positition at the end of Lauds and Vespers, the texts also suggest memorials. These antiphons include Christmas chants found on the feasts of Stephen, John the Evangelist and Holy Innocents; moreover, the chant on the first Sunday of Advent, Ecce dominus veniet (cao2509), is often used in Office books to commemorate All Saints during this season of the liturgical year. In some cases, these antiphons do not suggest memorials as clearly, for example, Quam pulchra es (cao4434) on the feast of the Assumption and Domine si tu es (cao2387) on the feast of Peter&amp;rsquo;s Chair. Both of these chants are typical of the prevailing feast. However, because of their position and how they are marked in the manuscript (in the same way as chants that seem less ambiguous), these chants have provisionally been identified as memorials. It may be that these antiphons were intended for use as memorials during the octaves of these feasts, but no clear indication is given in the manuscript.The index for this manuscript was drafted using Möller&amp;rsquo;s facsimile, in which differentia formulas are very difficult to read. Accordingly when present, differentia are indicated by question marks.Modes for responsories are provisional; they are being proposed according to an analysis of the neume patterns found in responsory verses and the modal designations of corresponding responsories in other sources represented in the database. This analysis has demonstrated that the standard verse tones are consistently represented within these leaves by neume patterns distinctive for each mode. Because of their provisional nature, all mode numbers for responsories in the file are followed by a question mark. Where there is any ambiguity (such as in cases where a non-standard tone is given for a verse or where the verse cannot be sufficiently read), a mode has not been assigned.Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers beginning with &amp;ldquo;que&amp;rdquo;.</description>

    <description>Five manuscripts of the Bamberg tradition survive (Bamberg, lit. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). Bamberg, lit. 23 was used by Hesbert in his Corpus Antiphonalium Officii (it is his manuscript &quot;B&quot;), but of these five manuscripts, only Bamberg, lit. 25 is written in staff notation (the other four consist of non-diastematic neumes). As the only one transcribable into modern notation, it is a valuable key to the musical tradition of Bamberg. Unfortunately, Bamberg, lit. 25 is incomplete; numerous folios are missing from the codex. Nevertheless, it has its treasures: most notably, the Office of Afra (83r-87r) and the Translation of Kunegunde (97r-99v). The latter is printed in full in Analecta hymnica, vol. 26, pp. 224-227.Differentiae are designated by a letter that indicates the pitch on which the differentia ends; where necessary, additional numbers are used to distinguish differentiae of the same mode that end on the same pitch.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;bam&quot;.</description>

    <description>The liturgical cursus and repertory, differing from the Benedictine liturgy of the abbey church, probably reflect those of the household chapel of the abbots of Fulda, who maintained a community of clerks drawn from the neighbouring collegiate chapels of Rasdorf, Hünfeld and Salmünster.Of particular interest are the historiae for the patron saints of Fulda, Boniface (88r) and Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix (130v). (These are currently being edited for the series Historiae, published by the Institute of Mediaeval Music.) Also rare is the Office for Kilian and Companions (112v), seventh-century Irish missionaries to Franconia. Notable is the inclusion of chants for Januarius of Benevento. The position of these chants in the antiphoner suggests the feast of his Translation (Oct. 23).The foliation for this index follows that given by a modern hand in the top right corner of the recto sides of the folios. The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by &amp;ldquo;ful.&amp;rdquo;</description>

    <description>Karlsruhe Aug. LX presents several challenges to the researcher. It is written in six different hands and seven notational styles spanning five centuries. A brief overview is provided below:
	1: late 12th-century Carolingian minuscule
	2: an early 13th-century hand on ff. 261r-262v
	3: a mid-13th-century Gothic minuscule (ff. 225v-230r--the added Offices of Elizabeth of Hungary and Catherine of Alexandria)
	4: a mid-15th-century hand (the added material on ff. 104r-144)
	5: 15th-century Gothic minuscule (ff. 133v-240v)
	6: 15th-century Humanist hand (140v)
	
	Karl Hain describes the characteristics of each hand in his Ein musikalischer Palimpsest, pp. 21-9; his discussion of the different notations, describing exactly where they are used in the manuscript, can be found on pp. 30-69. The seven types of notations he describes are the following:
	1: a 12th-century South-German notation with red F-line and yellow C-line similar to the one found in Graz 807 (ff. 82v and 225v-227v)
	2: German notation with red F-line and yellow C-line similar to the onle found in GB-Lbl-B. Add. 24680 and B-Br-2034 (ff. 219v-221r)
	3: German notation on four-line staff (223r)
	4: German notation (ff. 22r, 129v, 223v-224v, 231r, 233v)
	5: Hufnagel notation on four-line staff, found anywhere when not otherwise specified
	6: a 15th-century notation on five-line staff, found in the interpolated material (ff. 1r [211]-30v [270])
        7: Square notation on red four-line staff (ff. 191r-193r)
	
	Chants are often written in a haphazard manner: for example, the ending of the antiphon &amp;ldquo;O clavis David et sceptrum&amp;rdquo; (14v) is written four lines above where it is begun. This is especially prevalent among verses to responsories (e.g., see ff. 44v, 45r, 65v, 68v, 76r, 170r, 204r, 212v). An extreme example of this is the verse &amp;ldquo;Averte oculos meos ne videant,&amp;rdquo; which is begun on 103v but is continued on 142r.
	
	The full texts of the Offices of Elizabeth of Hungary and Catherine of Alexandria can be found in Analecta hymnica, vol. 25, pp. 253-8, and vol. 26, pp. 212-5, respectively. The rhymed Office for Benedict appears full in Analecta hymnica, vol. 25, pp. 145-9.
	
	Differentiae are not notated in Karlsruhe Aug. LX; instead, the mode and differentia of many of the antiphons are indicated by letters (a vowel followed by a consonant). Unfortunately, some of the differentiae appear to have been trimmed off.
Another challenging aspect of this manuscript concerns the multiple sets of folio numbers. The records here correspond to the folio numbering used by the Badische Landesbibliothek in their digital images (posted to the library website in 2015). The Cantus Database records are being edited during the summer of 2015; for example, the former fol. 004r is the new fol. 002r, old 004v = new 002v, etc.</description>
    <indexing_notes>The index for D-KA Aug. LX was prepared at the Catholic University of America by Joseph P. Metzinger, Lila Collamore, Keith Falconer, and Richard Rice. Tonary letters were copied into the records from Omlin’s book by Charles Downey. Folio numbers were adjusted and full texts were entered in 2015 by Marina Gallagher at the University of Waterloo, with editorial assistance from Debra Lacoste.</indexing_notes>

    <description>This (and St. Peter 15) are remarkable collections of sequences with alleluias interspersed.  St. Peter 16 is the older of the two.  Both collections are remarkably similar.  The folio numbering is confused.  Old ink numbers at top of page, but good pencil numbering in lower right hand corner of each recto.  I did not discover the pencil numbering in Erlangen, and only was able to get through f. 189r in Karlsruhe.</description>

    <description>This antiphoner was possibly written for use by the female abbey of Saint Mechtern in Cologne, renamed Saint Apern in 1477. 

An inscription was added to the cover page of the manuscript when it was acquired by the archiepiscopal seminary in Köln. It reads as follows: "Antiphonarium Romanum Coloniense Ordinis Cisterciensis pars hiemalis / e saeculo 12 vel initio saeculi 13 / e monasterio SS Bartholomaaeeii et Apri, moniatium ordinis Cistertiensis Coloniae olim florente. / pertinent ad bibliothecam Seminarii Archiepiscopalis Coloniensis."

Manuscript is written on parchment. Parchment from other manuscripts was reused for endpapers in the binding. The manuscript includes red, gold, blue, and green illuminated letters on ff. 1r, 18r. Folios are numbered in Roman numerals in the outer margin of each folio recto.

Differentiae are indicated by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number within each mode.</description>

    <description>The manuscript likely originated in a Benedictine male monastery in the diocese of Würzburg before coming to the Cologne Cathedral by the fourteenth century. The inclusion of chants for St. Burchard, the first bishop of Würzburg (ff. 135v-136r), and St. Kilian (ff. 118r-120v) suggest that the manuscript was used and/or created in the diocese of Würzburg.

The predominantly red and green miniatures (ff. 82v, 83r, and 88v) were not completed at the same time or place as the text and neumation. The miniatures depict the betrayal of Christ by Judas; the teachings of Christ; and scenes from the resurrection of Christ, respectively. They were completed earlier in Liège(?) at the end of the eleventh century and inserted into the manuscript. They are thought to be from Liège owing to the similar ornamentation style in Ms. 9369-9370 in the Royal Library of Belgium, a late-eleventh century MS from the Abbey of Saint Laurent in Liège.

In the late-thirteenth century, a tonary (ff. 209v-212r) in diastematic neumes was added to the manuscript, organized by mode.
By the fourteenth century, the manuscript had moved to the Cologne Cathedral, as indicated by an annotation on f. 206r that refers to the Archbishop Wilhelm of Gennep (1349-1362): “Wilhelmus Dei gratia sancta Coloniensis ecclesiae.”

Physical Description: Parchment leaves. Rebound in the mid-eighteenth century with paper over cardboard. The manuscript includes eighteen ornamented text initials (e.g. 11r) and three full-page colour miniatures (ff. 82v, 83r, and 88v). In addition to the antiphoner (ff. 10v-209r), the manuscript also contains a liturgical kalendar (ff. 1r-6r) for every month except January; a tonary (209v-212r) that was added in the late-thirteenth century); a hymnary (ff. 212-216v); and a psalter, cantica, and orations (ff. 217r-279r). The leaves are numbered in a later hand in pencil in the upper right-hand corner of each recto side. The miniatures (ff. 82v, 83r, and 88v) were likely completed in the Maas region, near Liège, at the end of the eleventh century; the text and neumes date from the beginning of the twelfth century; and the tonary (ff. 209v-212r) was added in the late-thirteenth century.

Differentiae in this manuscript are indicated by letters in the margins which may correspond with the differentiae in the tonary, but there are no clear indications of how the two systems correlate with each other. Those provided in the tonary are transcribed in the differentia table.</description>

    <description>Early tenth-century antiphoner, somehow connected with Regino of Prüm.
The manuscript consists of three parts:
1 texts on music theory (f. 4r-36v),
2 an appendix to a (non-extant) gradual (f. 36v-51v),
3 a monastic antiphoner (51v-147v, 3r-3v).
The parts are written continuosly by the same hand (as it seems), except for some additions at the end of the antiphoner.
Part 1 contains Regino's Epistola de armonica institutione, a shortened version of Regino's tonary and another tonary.
Part 2 contains the alleluia series for sundays, for the proprium de tempore and for the commune sanctorum, then a group of tracts that do not belong to the standard repertory, finally antiphons for the adoratio crucis and for processions.
Part 3 is introduced by the rubric "Incipit breuiarium nocturnale per circulum anni in laude dei canendum". Despite the designation "nocturnale" it is a full antiphoner; the designation "breuiarium" may indicate that the chants are not written in full. Normally each chant begins on a new line and is broken off at the end of the line. These text incipits, however, are given full musical notation (French adiastematic notation). Furthermore the mode of antiphons (except invitatories) and great responsories is indicated in the margin. There are several systems for the indication of mode: 
a) abbreviations for the greek names (AP - authenticus protus, PP - plaga proti, AD - authenticus deuterus, PD plaga deuteri, AT - authenticus tritus, PT - plaga triti, AHT - authenticus tethrarchus, PHT - plaga tethrarchi) on f. 52r-109r; 
b) roman numbers (I.To. etc.) on f. 52r-59v additionally to a) for responsories;
c) letters in place of numbers (A - 1, B - 2 etc.) on f. 100v-109r additionally to a).
All these systems can be found in this manuscript's version of Regino's tonary. Additionally the differentiae (here called divisiones) are indicated for the antiphons. They are largely congruent with Regino's tonary. From f. 109v there are no modal indications. Sometimes the modal indication for a responsory is contradicted by the notation of the responsory verse. In the index preference is given to the notation.

The date of the manuscript is usually given as beginning of the tenth century. Since Regino wrote his tract and tonary after 899, when he came from Prüm to Trier, the manuscript must be close to the author. Its place of origin cannot be determined. The clearest indicator is a charter on f. 1v-2v that deals with posessions in the region of Metz (see Bernhard, p. 13-15).</description>

    <description>The latest material in the manuscript appears to be Julian of Speyer&amp;rsquo;s Office of Francis, which has been dated recently to approximately 1235 (Miskuly, 1989).An addition (possibly from the fourteenth century) has been made to the kalendar of the feast of the Roman church, St. Pancras de secretario (van Dijk, 1956). Other additions to the kalendar have been associated by van Dijk with a mid-thirteenth century Roman liturgical reform, (also van Dijk, 1956), suggesting that the manuscript was in Rome perhaps as early as the thirteenth century.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary in terms only of immediately repeated notes, presence/absence of liquesence or neumation are give the same differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter in the first column of the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field (see File Description).Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers beginning with &quot;fra&quot;. The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO in this index are consistent with those used for the other Franciscan manuscripts in the database:Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 693Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 694Assisi, Cattedrale San Rufino - Archivio e Biblioteca, 5Budapest, Egyetemi Könyvtár (University Library), lat. 118, 119, 122, 121Chicago, Newberry Library, 24Città del Vaticano (Roma), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, lat. 8737Fribourg (Switzerland), Bibliothèèque des Cordeliers, 2Napoli, Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III, vi.

End of an older sequentiary—five folios, probably added to fill out repertoire.  Only duplication is “Congaudent” fragment on first folio.  c. 153v:  two sequences added at end of ms.</description>

    <description>The ms is principally a collection of lives of saints.  The sequence for Januarius is a supplement to his life, along with a notated office.  Use of name and format suggest a sequentiary as probable source.  The final sequence seems to be an afterthrought.  Notation of the first sequence is carefully and competently copied.   Date of sequences’ addition to the ms is probably late 11th century, at least second half of the century.</description>

    <description>F nos., in pencil, are barely visible in lower right hand corners of recto.P. numbers are written in very tiny numbers in the lower corner of the writing area of each page.  They are difficult to see, but invaluable.  They were probably written there quite early.  They are evidence that the book was rebound in the wrong order, and supply missing places in one place.

Catalogue says saecula XIV.  If it is 14th c, it is late.  I judge the date to be early 15th century, but that could be off by 50 yrs in either direction.

    <description>The antiphoners from the monastery of SS Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg represent the oldest complete Office chant tradition of the so-called Melk Reform. Several are preserved in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich, while others are now in the Staats- und Stadtbibliothek Augsburg. (The later antiphoner Clm 4306 was chosen as a source for the summer temporale, despite curtailment of the Office, because apparently no other codex has survived.)Otherwise the tradition can be found in books produced only later, from the monastery of Ebersberg (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 5801) and (much abbreviated) from the monastery of Lorch (Stuttgart, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, Mus. I. 63+64). Only one witness to this late medieval monastic reform of the liturgy is known from the monastery of Melk itself: an antiphoner for the day hours only, Melk 756.In the antiphoners from SS Ulrich and Afra, apart from the Offices for the local saints Afra, Ulrich and Simpert, there are two rhymed offices typical of the Melk tradition, for Benedict and the Visitation of Mary. Also typical of this tradition is the announcement of the Roman origin of the chants "secundum rubricam romanam". All these 'Melk' codices are exactly concordant in the order of chants and the melodies. This is not a typical South German tradition (like, for instance, the Hirsau tradition in Karlsruhe LX and many other manuscripts) but a Roman tradition from the early 13th century. The tradition adopted by the reformers at the monastery of Melk was that of the Benedictine monastery of Subiaco. They took over not only the consuetudines but also the liturgical tradition of the Office and the Holy Mass. This tradition is completely different from South German traditions (and also presumably from the tradition of SS Ulrich and Afra before the Melk reform was introduced). Nor is the Subiaco tradition an old Italian, Benedictine tradition such as that preserved in the Lucca antiphoner (Lucca 601), but one based on the usage of the papal court in the Lateran church, which seems to have been instituted in the early 13th century during the pontificate of the popes Innocent III (1198-1216) and Honorius III (1216-1227). (The question of how far the canons of St. Fridian in Lucca influenced this tradition remains to be answered.)This train of events explains the closeness of the Augsburg codices in the Melk tradition to early Franciscan codices. (Much the same pattern is to be observed in books of the Olivetan reform, beginning in the year 1313, which have the same order of the chants and the "rubrica romana"). There are some small differences in the melodies, but not many. All these reforms are marked by an adaptation of the secular to the monastic cursus, an abbreviation of the Office, a uniform practice of modal assignments and differentiae, and, finally, a limitation of the ambitus.All the chants, provided with note incipits and integrated in a web database, can be researched on www.cantus-augusta.de.Differentiae have been provided with a two-character code within each mode; the letter indicates the final pitch and the number has been assigned arbitrarily. All chants not found in CAO have been assigned numbers prefixed by "ulr".</description>

Nor is the Subiaco tradition an old Italian, Benedictine tradition such as that preserved in the Lucca antiphoner (Lucca 601), but one based on the usage of the papal court in the Lateran church, which seems to have been instituted in the early 13th century during the pontificate of the popes Innocent III (1198-1216) and Honorius III (1216-1227). (The question of how far the canons of St. Fridian in Lucca influenced this tradition remains to be answered.)This train of events explains the closeness of the Augsburg codices in the Melk tradition to early Franciscan codices. (Much the same pattern is to be observed in books of the Olivetan reform, beginning in the year 1313, which have the same order of the chants and the &quot;rubrica romana&quot;). There are some small differences in the melodies, but not many. All these reforms are marked by an adaptation of the secular to the monastic cursus, an abbreviation of the Office, a uniform practice of modal assignments and differentiae, and, finally, a limitation of the ambitus.All the chants, provided with note incipits and integrated in a web database, can be researched on www.cantus-augusta.de.Differentiae have been provided with a two-character code within each mode; the letter indicates the final pitch and the number has been assigned arbitrarily. All chants not found in CAO have been assigned numbers prefixed by &quot;ulr&quot;.</description>

    <description>The antiphoners from the monastery of SS Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg represent the oldest complete Office chant tradition of the so-called Melk Reform. Several are preserved in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich, while others are now in the Staats- und Stadtbibliothek Augsburg. (The later antiphoner Clm 4306 was chosen as a source for the summer temporale, despite curtailment of the Office, because apparently no other codex has survived.)Otherwise the tradition can be found in books produced only later, from the monastery of Ebersberg (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 5801) and (much abbreviated) from the monastery of Lorch (Stuttgart, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, Mus. I. 63+64). Only one witness to this late medieval monastic reform of the liturgy is known from the monastery of Melk itself: an antiphoner for the day hours only, Melk 756.In the antiphoners from SS Ulrich and Afra, apart from the Offices for the local saints Afra, Ulrich and Simpert, there are two rhymed offices typical of the Melk tradition, for Benedict and the Visitation of Mary. Also typical of this tradition is the announcement of the Roman origin of the chants &quot;secundum rubricam romanam&quot;. All these &amp;#39;Melk&amp;#39; codices are exactly concordant in the order of chants and the melodies. This is not a typical South German tradition (like, for instance, the Hirsau tradition in Karlsruhe LX and many other manuscripts) but a Roman tradition from the early 13th century. The tradition adopted by the reformers at the monastery of Melk was that of the Benedictine monastery of Subiaco. They took over not only the consuetudines but also the liturgical tradition of the Office and the Holy Mass. This tradition is completely different from South German traditions (and also presumably from the tradition of SS Ulrich and Afra before the Melk reform was introduced). Nor is the Subiaco tradition an old Italian, Benedictine tradition such as that preserved in the Lucca antiphoner (Lucca 601), but one based on the usage of the papal court in the Lateran church, which seems to have been instituted in the early 13th century during the pontificate of the popes Innocent III (1198-1216) and Honorius III (1216-1227). (The question of how far the canons of St. Fridian in Lucca influenced this tradition remains to be answered.)This train of events explains the closeness of the Augsburg codices in the Melk tradition to early Franciscan codices. (Much the same pattern is to be observed in books of the Olivetan reform, beginning in the year 1313, which have the same order of the chants and the &quot;rubrica romana&quot;). There are some small differences in the melodies, but not many. All these reforms are marked by an adaptation of the secular to the monastic cursus, an abbreviation of the Office, a uniform practice of modal assignments and differentiae, and, finally, a limitation of the ambitus.All the chants, provided with note incipits and integrated in a web database, can be researched on www.cantus-augusta.de.Differentiae have been provided with a two-character code within each mode; the letter indicates the final pitch and the number has been assigned arbitrarily.

    <description>These five manuscripts were written in the 1430s for use by the Carmelites of Mainz: an inscription in Codex A (now in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich) gives a date of 1430 but an inscription in Codex B gives a date of 1432. They were commissioned by the Carmelite Johannes Fabri in memory of his parents. They follow the rite of the Carmelite Order as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka, promulgated by the General Chapter of London in 1312. Only feasts admitted to the Carmelite liturgy after this date are different from the stipulations of Sibert&amp;rsquo;s Ordinal.In the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field of the widescreen version for many records of this index is the page number referring to Sibert de Beka&amp;rsquo;s ordinal.This antiphoner contains several Offices not found in CAO: they include the Offices for Thomas of Canterbury, the Three Marys, Corpus Christi, the Visitation of Mary, Anne, Augustine, the Presentation of Mary, and Catherine. Some of these Offices have been edited in Analecta hymnica and/or appear within other CANTUS files. The Office for Thomas of Canterbury was a very popular rhymed Office and appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 13, pp. 238-42 (an edition also appears in James Boyce, O. Carm., &amp;ldquo;Cantica Carmelitana: The Chants of the Carmelite Office,&amp;rdquo; Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1984). The rhymed Office for the Three Marys appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 38-45 (see also bibliography, below).The partially rhymed Office of the Visitation of Mary appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 48, pp. 427-29. The Office for the Presentation of Mary appears to be unique, and was probably composed within the Mainz Carmelite convent; its chants are all derived from other Offices, primarily that of Thomas of Canterbury. The Office for Catherine appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 26, pp. 212-15. A partial Office, with some versified chants, is given for the feast of the Transfiguration. Two feasts prominent in the Carmelite rite are the Commemoration of the Resurrection (celebrated on the last Sunday of the year), and the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Joseph, on October 6th. The former is not specifically represented here, probably because the chants were simply borrowed from the Easter Sunday liturgy. The chants for the feast of the Patriarchs (Codex D, f. 101) are standard and are simply borrowed from other occasions and compiled for this specifically Carmelite celebration. Similarly, Marian chants were borrowed and compiled for the feast of Our Lady of the Snows (Codex C, f. 259v).A number of pages are missing from the antiphoner, especially in Codices A and D; many of these pages occur at the beginning of Matins, either at the first antiphon or first responsory. Since some illuminations survive in the manuscripts, it is reasonable to surmise that the missing folios contain illustrations of some kind.All chants in the antiphoner not found in CAO are assigned an arbitrary number beginning with &amp;ldquo;mai.&amp;rdquo; Differentiae are assigned arbitrary numbers.</description>

    <description>These five manuscripts were written in the 1430s for use by the Carmelites of Mainz: an inscription in Codex A (now in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich) gives a date of 1430 but an inscription in Codex B gives a date of 1432. They were commissioned by the Carmelite Johannes Fabri in memory of his parents. They follow the rite of the Carmelite Order as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka, promulgated by the General Chapter of London in 1312. Only feasts admitted to the Carmelite liturgy after this date are different from the stipulations of Sibert&amp;rsquo;s Ordinal.In the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field of the widescreen version for many records of this index is the page number referring to Sibert de Beka&amp;rsquo;s ordinal.This antiphoner contains several Offices not found in CAO: they include the Offices for Thomas of Canterbury, the Three Marys, Corpus Christi, the Visitation of Mary, Anne, Augustine, the Presentation of Mary, and Catherine. Some of these Offices have been edited in Analecta hymnica and/or appear within other CANTUS files. The Office for Thomas of Canterbury was a very popular rhymed Office and appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 13, pp. 238-42 (an edition also appears in James Boyce, O. Carm., &amp;ldquo;Cantica Carmelitana: The Chants of the Carmelite Office,&amp;rdquo; Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1984). The rhymed Office for the Three Marys appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 38-45 (see also bibliography, below).The partially rhymed Office of the Visitation of Mary appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 48, pp. 427-29. The Office for the Presentation of Mary appears to be unique, and was probably composed within the Mainz Carmelite convent; its chants are all derived from other Offices, primarily that of Thomas of Canterbury. The Office for Catherine appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 26, pp. 212-15. A partial Office, with some versified chants, is given for the feast of the Transfiguration. Two feasts prominent in the Carmelite rite are the Commemoration of the Resurrection (celebrated on the last Sunday of the year), and the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Joseph, on October 6th. The former is not specifically represented here, probably because the chants were simply borrowed from the Easter Sunday liturgy. The chants for the feast of the Patriarchs (Codex D, f. 101) are standard and are simply borrowed from other occasions and compiled for this specifically Carmelite celebration. Similarly, Marian chants were borrowed and compiled for the feast of Our Lady of the Snows (Codex C, f. 259v).A number of pages are missing from the antiphoner, especially in Codices A and D; many of these pages occur at the beginning of Matins, either at the first antiphon or first responsory. Since some illuminations survive in the manuscripts, it is reasonable to surmise that the missing folios contain illustrations of some kind.All chants in the antiphoner not found in CAO are assigned an arbitrary number beginning with &amp;ldquo;mai.&amp;rdquo; Differentiae are assigned arbitrary numbers.</description>

    <description>Stuttgart HB.I.55 was used at the Abbey of Weingarten, a Benedictine house in Wuerttemberg, Germany. Although it was originally founded some time after the year 934 as a house for women religious, the nuns of Weingarten moved to Altomuenster in Freising in 1056, and the monks of Altomuenster moved to Weingarten. Under Welf IV and his wife Judith, Weingarten became an imperial abbey; and after 1088 it followed the customs of Hirsau. The abbey was suppressed in 1803 and restored in 1922. The contents of Stuttgart HB.I.55 are misbound: the table below indicates their correct sequence. 5r-5v: Advent I 2r-3v: Advent I to Advent II 6r-7v: Advent II to Advent III 4r-4v: Advent III lacuna 8r-15v: Lucy to Christmas lacuna 16r-21v: John the Evangelist to Epiphany lacuna 22r-84v: Epiphany to Easter Monday 86r-100v: Easter Monday to Ascension 85r-85v: Ascension 101r-126v: Pentecost to Laurence lacuna 127r-190v: Assumption to Benedict In addition to being misbound and having four lacunae, the manuscript contains two leaves (55 and 157) that have numbers that are repeated on the leaves that follow them: there are two leaves marked 55 and two marked 157. In each instance the recto of the second of the pair of leaves is referred to in the index not as &quot;r&quot; but as &quot;w&quot;; and &quot;x&quot; is used in place of &quot;v&quot; for the verso. This enables them to be distinguished from the leaves that precede them; and when the file is sorted on folio number (including &quot;r,&quot; &quot;v,&quot; &quot;w,&quot; and &quot;x,&quot;) the order of folios in the source is preserved. The manuscript is notated in non-diastematic neumes, which makes the identification of mode difficult in many instances. Wherever possible the series of neumes used to notate the verses of responsories have been matched with modal formulas, and the modes of those responsories thus identified. It has also been possible to identify the modes of many antiphons in the index. The manuscript employs two different systems for specifying differentiae: neumes and tonary letters. The neumes appear in the outer margins of the openings, the tonary letters in the inner margins. The index records the tonary letter or letters (if present) in an &quot;extra&quot; field to reflect what appears to be signified by the differentiae given in neumes. These designations are based on the incomplete tonary at the end of the manuscript; tonary letters have been assigned arbitrarily to the differentiae of the first three modes.Stuttgart HB.I.55 contains several CAO Offices that are known in relatively limited regions (i.e., Gregory, Mary Magdalene, Afra, and Gall) but contains only two Offices not found in CAO, those for King Oswald and Benedict. The text of the former is edited in Analecta hymnica, vol. 13, pp. 209-12, and the text of the latter is also in Analecta hymnica vol. 25, pp. 145-9.All chants not found in CAO have been assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;wei&quot;.</description>

    <description>The manuscript D-Trb Abt. 95, Nr. 5 (hereafter Trier 5) is a small book measuring 16.4 cm by 11.4 cm. Its 145 folios comprise three parts written in different hands. The first part is a legendary that contains saints' vitae (folios 1-103v). The second part consists of three proper offices for the Anglo-Saxon missionary siblings and Eichstätt patrons Willibald, Wunnebald, and Walburga (folios 104v-141). The change in hand and format between these sections, together with the fact that folios 104 and 141v were originally left empty, suggests that the offices were copied as nineteen bifolios, folded to create a libellus with a blank cover—a small book which could easily have been held in the cantor’s hand. Once bound with the legendary and additional pages, folios 141v- 145v were inscribed with additional hagiographic material. Written on the inside of the back cover is the sequence Magnificandus et omnicolendus for Pope Pascal II, who died in 1118. Due to this composite nature of the manuscript, estimates of its date have varied from late tenth-century to early twelfth-century.

The eleventh-century chronicler Anonymous of Herrieden (Anonymus Haserensis) attributes the offices for Willibald and Wunnebald to Reginold, Bishop of Eichstätt from 966-991, and the Walburga office to the poet-composer Wolfhard von Herrieden, author of the late ninth-century Miracula S. Walburgae. The three offices follow the secular cursus and reflect the liturgy of the Eichstätt cathedral. The texts of the Walburga office are drawn from Wolfhard’s Miracula, while those for Willibald and Wunnebald follow the vitae composed by the nun Huneberc of Heidenheim. Dörr, Schlager, and Wohnhaas suggest that Reginold composed the office for Saint Willibald for the occasion of his translation on April 22nd, 989, providing a terminus post quem for the creation of the libellus that was later incorporated into Trier 5. I have suggested that Reginold’s offices for Willibald and Wunnebald were intended as the concluding members of a trilogy: one that elevated the two brothers, whose fame was previously eclipsed by that of their celebrated sister, and claimed the legacy of this trio of saints for the diocese. The conclusion of this proper office trilogy moreover established Reginold in a poetic and compositional lineage descending from Wolfhard of Herrieden.  

The text of Trier 5 is written in Caroline miniscule. Many of the initials for the office texts were never completed. The manuscript’s adiastematic neumes use St. Gall forms, but without litterae significativae. The notational hand is characterized by long, tapered pen strokes with a prominent convex ductus. Reginold's remarkable trilingual trope Terminus et idem interminus for the last Matins responsory of the Willibald office was first described by Anonymous of Herrieden. The text linguistically retraces Willibald’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem by traveling through Latin, Greek, Hebrew and back through Greek to Latin. The trope is also transmitted independently from the office in D-Mü Clm 14377, from St. Emmeram in Regensburg. In both sources, the Greek and Hebrew portions of the text are transliterated into Latin characters. The transcription of the Hebrew portion of the trope found in the CANTUS Database is based on the transcription by Daniels et alia. The transcription of the Greek portions of the trope follows J. L. Van Dieten’s reconstruction. A complete translation of the trope into German may be found in Dörr, Schlager, and Wohnhaas.

Wolfhard of Herrieden’s office for St. Walburga is also transmitted in the fragment D-Mü Clm 29316(5 (antiphoner, Salzburg, 10th-11th century.) Selected Matins responsories from the office are recorded in CZ-Pu VI.E.4c, a twelfth-century breviary from the convent of St. George in Prague, and in NL-ZUa 6, a fifteenth-century antiphoner from the chapter church of St. Walburga in Zutphen. The Lauds antiphons of the Walburga office are transmitted in the above sources, and in the fourteenth-century antiphoner CZ-Pu XIV.B.13 from the St. George convent. Finally, the magnificat antiphon for second vespers is transmitted in the Münster printed antiphonal of 1537. Textual evidence from printed breviaries shows that a modified version of the Walburga office was in use at the Eichstätt cathedral into the seventeenth century.

Inside the back cover of the book (here indexed as folio 146) appears the addition of the un-notated sequence Magnificandus et omnicolendus for Pope Paschal II (1099-1118). My transcription adapts that of Thomas Haye for the first seventeen versicles. 

This project was completed with a grant from the Graduate College of the University of Northern Iowa. My thanks go to Mother Franziska Kloos, Abbess of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Walburg, Eichstätt, and to the staffs of the Bistumsarchiv Trier, the special collections department of the Universitätsbibliothek Eichstätt-Ingolstadt, and the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library, St. John's University, for their research assistance.</description>

    <description>Monastic antiphoner from the abbey of Prüm (Eifel).
The antiphoner is part of a miscellaneous manuscript, filling f. 107r-129r, with later additions on f. 129r and f. 106r-106v. It contains only text incipits without musical notation, ordered in three columns.
The original destination for Prüm is attested by a hymn for St. Chrysanthus and Daria in the hymnary section of the manuscript as well as by an office for St. Goar (consisting of commune pieces only) in the antiphoner. The relics of St. Chrysanthus and Daria were translated from Rome to Münstereifel, a dependency of Prüm, in 836; the church of St. Goar was equally a dependency of Prüm. The manuscript was at some time brought to the monastery of St. Martin in Trier, perhaps by Regino of Prüm who left Prüm in 899 and became abbot of St. Martin. If this assumption is correct, the thorough revision of the antiphoner can be seen as representing the use of St. Martin.
There seems to be a consistent layer of revision, done by varying means:
addition of numbers for the reordering of responsories,
addition of text incipits in the margins or between the lines,
cancelling or underlining of text incipits,
erasure and rewriting.
In many cases it is easy to read and to distinguish the two layers. In the case of erasures, sometimes the original text can be reconstructed from traces of letters, sometimes not. (For difficult cases the manuscript has been consulted in original.)
For several reasons it has been decided to produce two separate indices for the original and the revised layer. That implies that the index "original" ignores all parts that are added later, the index "revised" on the other hand places the pieces in the order intended by the various means of revision.</description>

    <description>The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.</description>

    <description>The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.</description>

    <description>H 140 consists of 3 volumes, roughly bound with cardboard.  Three volumes form one Graduale, at least what is left of what once was a graduale.  Only eight pieces can be named, four of which are only fragments.  The sequentiary seems to have been based on that of H 109, but one cannot be sure.  Clearly 16th century, perhaps evan as late as 1600.</description>

    <description>This manuscript and the subsequent sixteen volumes were created for use at the Augsburg Cathedral. This multi-volume antiphoner is not well-known. It is not included in the recent catalogues of the Danish Royal Library, and so, has been identified with its old signature ("Gl. Kgl. Saml. 3449 8°") from a library catalogue of the year 1784 (Gl. kgl. Saml. = Old Royal Collection). The Catalogus manuscriptorum in Octavo Bibliothecae Regiae (1784) lists this source as "Breviarium in Membrana eleganti, rubris miniatis et litt. init. auro et coloribus distinctis, cont. Hymnos per totum annum Notis Musicis interlinearibus distinctos, ut et Lectiones nonullas (XVII Vol.)".

Copenhagen 3449 8o constitutes the only known preserved Office source for the liturgy of Augsburg cathedral; it contains more or less the whole chant repertoire. The printed antiphoner edited by Ratdolt in 1495 (London, British Library, printed book IB. 6753, indexed in Cantus) and some manuscript antiphoners from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries follow the cathedral liturgy but contain principally chants for Vespers. The texts of the chant repertoire contained in Copenhagen 3449 8o are already found in manuscript and printed breviaries of the fifteenth century. These breviaries also contain the texts of a large number of late medieval special Offices (amongst others, for the two Augsburg saints Afra and Ulrich) and responsory prosulae, all of which are found in Copenhagen 3449 8o.

Apart from the profusion of special offices, the chant repertoire is quite typical of south German sources, with analogies to the Hirsau tradition (but with secular cursus). A synopsis of antiphon melodies (cf. doctoral thesis of Robert Klugseder on the chant tradition of the Benedictine monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg) also allies Copenhagen 3449 8o to a group of other south German sources (e.g. Zwiefalten, Bamberg, St Emmeram Regensburg, etc.).

It is difficult to say why this antiphoner was copied so late in the sixteenth century. The distinct traces of usage indicate that it was not produced simply as an item for the archives. After the confusions of the Reformation and the reorganization of the liturgy after the Council of Trent, no one would expect such an antiphoner to have been made.

The tradition of the Augsburg cathedral church, represented by Copenhagen 3449 8o, has no similarities with the late medieval tradition of the monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg (D-Mbs clm 4303ff). The latter tradition clearly reflects the influence of the “Melk reform.” However, the Copenhagen source has many similarities with the antiphoner in two volumes from Kranj (Krainburg) in Slovenia (Ljubljana 18 and 19). These books were written in Augsburg in 1491 and conform to a large extent with the liturgical tradition of Augsburg cathedral.

It is unknown how the books came to Denmark, but it was probably during the Thirty Years' War. The manuscript was at the Copenhagen Library by 1787.

An unusual characteristic of this manuscript is that, for all antiphons, the first verse of each psalm or canticle has been written out in full and completely notated. These psalm- and canticle-verses, not usually present in antiphoners, have been assigned individual records in this index. These entries have been indicated with "PS" in the genre field (for both psalm and canticle texts); psalm numbers and canticle names have been entered into the addendum field.

The differentiae within each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary only in terms of immediately repeated notes, neumation, or the presence or absence of liquesence have been assigned the same two-digit differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter suffix (e.g. A1a, A1b, A1c, etc.).

The manuscript is written on parchment with red borders, octavo format. Brown leather cover, originally with clasps (now damaged), binders in the corners, stamps with gold imprinting. The manuscript is in a good state of preservation aside from the worn covers. Front cover has a Christus monogram with a cross and Corpus Christi, and the back cover shows Maria and Madonna with child (orb and sceptre, Madonna with corona on crescent moon). Important feasts feature rich illuminations, including f. 1r (Advent) and f. 174v (Nativitas Domini). The text is written in Gothic script with red and blue initials.</description>
    <indexing_notes>The inventories for all volumes of DK-Kk 3449 8o were prepared by Robert Klugseder (Universität Regensburg), with proofreading by Andrew Mitchell (The University of Western Ontario), and editorial assistance from Debra Lacoste (The University of Western Ontario). The manuscript description was written by Robert Klugseder (April 2006), with editing by Debra Lacoste (January 2007, July 2019), and Rebecca Shaw (June 2019).</indexing_notes>

These psalm- and canticle-verses, not usually present in antiphoners, have been assigned individual records in this index. These entries have been indicated with "PS" in the genre field (for both psalm and canticle texts); psalm numbers and canticle names have been entered into the addendum field.

The differentiae within each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary only in terms of immediately repeated notes, neumation, or the presence or absence of liquesence have been assigned the same two-digit differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter suffix (e.g. A1a, A1b, A1c, etc.).

The manuscript is written on parchment with red borders, octavo format. Brown leather cover, originally with clasps (now damaged), binders in the corners, stamps with gold imprinting. The manuscript is in a good state of preservation aside from the worn covers. Front cover has a Christus monogram with a cross and Corpus Christi, and the back cover shows Maria and Madonna with child (orb and sceptre, Madonna with corona on crescent moon). Important feasts feature rich illuminations, including f. 1r (Advent) and f. 174v (Nativitas Domini). The text is written in Gothic script with red and blue initials.</description>

    <description>This manuscript and the other sixteen volumes were created for use at the Augsburg Cathedral. This multi-volume antiphoner is not well-known. It is not included in the recent catalogues of the Danish Royal Library, and so, has been identified with its old signature ("Gl. Kgl. Saml. 3449 8°") from a library catalogue of the year 1784 (Gl. kgl. Saml. = Old Royal Collection). The Catalogus manuscriptorum in Octavo Bibliothecae Regiae (1784) lists this source as "Breviarium in Membrana eleganti, rubris miniatis et litt. init. auro et coloribus distinctis, cont. Hymnos per totum annum Notis Musicis interlinearibus distinctos, ut et Lectiones nonullas (XVII Vol.)"

Copenhagen 3449 8o constitutes the only preserved Office source for the liturgy of Augsburg cathedral; it contains more or less the whole chant repertoire. The printed antiphoner edited by Ratdolt in 1495 (London, British Library, printed book IB. 6753) and some manuscript antiphoners from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries follow the cathedral liturgy but contain principally chants for Vespers. The texts of the chant repertoire contained in Copenhagen 3449 8o are already found in manuscript and printed breviaries of the fifteenth century. These breviaries also contain the texts of a large number of late medieval special Offices (amongst others, for the two Augsburg saints Afra and Ulrich) and responsory prosulae, all of which are found in Copenhagen 3449 8o.

Apart from the profusion of special offices, the chant repertoire is quite typical of south German sources, with analogies to the Hirsau tradition (but with secular cursus). A synopsis of antiphon melodies (cf. doctoral thesis of Robert Klugseder on the chant tradition of the Benedictine monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg) also allies Copenhagen 3449 8o to a group of other south German sources (e.g. Zwiefalten, Bamberg, St Emmeram Regensburg etc.).

It is difficult to say why this antiphoner was copied so late in the sixteenth century. The distinct traces of usage indicate that it was not produced simply as an item for the archives. After the confusions of the Reformation and the reorganization of the liturgy after the Council of Trent, no one would expect such an antiphoner to have been made.

The tradition of the Augsburg cathedral church, represented by Copenhagen 3449 8o, has no similarities with the late medieval tradition of the monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg (D-Mbs clm 4303ff). The later tradition clearly reflects the influence of the “Melk reform.” However, the Copenhagen source has many similarities with the antiphoner in two volumes from Kranj (Krainburg) in Slovenia (Ljubljana 18 and 19). These books were written in Augsburg in 1491 and conform to a large extent with the liturgical tradition of Augsburg cathedral.

It is unknown how the books came to Denmark, but it was probably during the Thirty Years' War. The manuscript was at the Copenhagen Library by 1787.

Copenhagen 3449 8o constitutes the only preserved Office source for the liturgy of Augsburg cathedral; it contains more or less the whole chant repertoire. The printed antiphoner edited by Ratdolt in 1495 (London, British Library, printed book IB. 6753) and some manuscript antiphoners from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries follow the cathedral liturgy but contain principally chants for Vespers. The texts of the chant repertoire contained in Copenhagen 3449 8o are already found in manuscript and printed breviaries of the fifteenth century. These breviaries also contain the texts of a large number of late medieval special Offices (amongst others, for the two Augsburg saints Afra and Ulrich) and responsory prosulae, all of which are found in Copenhagen 3449 8o.

Apart from the profusion of special offices, the chant repertoire is quite typical of south German sources, with analogies to the Hirsau tradition (but with secular cursus). A synopsis of antiphon melodies (cf. doctoral thesis of Robert Klugseder on the chant tradition of the Benedictine monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg) also allies Copenhagen 3449 8o to a group of other south German sources (e.g. Zwiefalten, Bamberg, St Emmeram Regensburg etc.).

It is difficult to say why this antiphoner was copied so late in the sixteenth century. The distinct traces of usage indicate that it was not produced simply as an item for the archives. After the confusions of the Reformation and the reorganization of the liturgy after the Council of Trent, no one would expect such an antiphoner to have been made.

The tradition of the Augsburg cathedral church, represented by Copenhagen 3449 8o, has no similarities with the late medieval tradition of the monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg (D-Mbs clm 4303ff). The later tradition clearly reflects the influence of the “Melk reform.” However, the Copenhagen source has many similarities with the antiphoner in two volumes from Kranj (Krainburg) in Slovenia (Ljubljana 18 and 19). These books were written in Augsburg in 1491 and conform to a large extent with the liturgical tradition of Augsburg cathedral.

It is unknown how the books came to Denmark, but it was probably during the Thirty Years' War. The manuscript was at the Copenhagen Library by 1787.

An unusual characteristic of this manuscript is that, for all antiphons, the first verse of each psalm or canticle has been written out in full and completely notated. These psalm- and canticle-verses, not usually present in antiphoners, have been assigned individual records in this index. These entries have been indicated with "PS" in the genre field (for both psalm and canticle texts); psalm numbers and canticle names have been entered into the addendum field.

The differentiae within each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary only in terms of immediately repeated notes, neumation, or the presence or absence of liquesence have been assigned the same two-digit differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter suffix (e.g. A1a, A1b, A1c, etc.).

Manuscript written on parchment with red borders, octavo format. Brown leather cover, originally with clasps (now damaged), binders in the corners, stamps with gold imprinting. The manuscript is in a good state of preservation aside from the worn covers. The front cover has a Christus monogram with a cross and Corpus Christi, and the back cover shows Maria and Madonna with child (orb and sceptre, Madonna with corona on crescent moon). The text is written in Gothic script with red and blue initials.</description>

    <description>This manuscript and the other sixteen volumes were created for use at the Augsburg Cathedral. This multi-volume antiphoner is not well-known. It is not included in the recent catalogues of the Danish Royal Library, and so, has been identified with its old signature ("Gl. Kgl. Saml. 3449 8°") from a library catalogue of the year 1784 (Gl. kgl. Saml. = Old Royal Collection). The Catalogus manuscriptorum in Octavo Bibliothecae Regiae (1784) lists this source as "Breviarium in Membrana eleganti, rubris miniatis et litt. init. auro et coloribus distinctis, cont. Hymnos per totum annum Notis Musicis interlinearibus distinctos, ut et Lectiones nonullas (XVII Vol.)"

Copenhagen 3449 8o constitutes the only preserved Office source for the liturgy of Augsburg cathedral; it contains more or less the whole chant repertoire. The printed antiphoner edited by Ratdolt in 1495 (London, British Library, printed book IB. 6753) and some manuscript antiphoners from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries follow the cathedral liturgy but contain principally chants for Vespers. The texts of the chant repertoire contained in Copenhagen 3449 8o are already found in manuscript and printed breviaries of the fifteenth century. These breviaries also contain the texts of a large number of late medieval special Offices (amongst others, for the two Augsburg saints Afra and Ulrich) and responsory prosulae, all of which are found in Copenhagen 3449 8o.

Apart from the profusion of special offices, the chant repertoire is quite typical of south German sources, with analogies to the Hirsau tradition (but with secular cursus). A synopsis of antiphon melodies (cf. doctoral thesis of Robert Klugseder on the chant tradition of the Benedictine monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg) also allies Copenhagen 3449 8o to a group of other south German sources (e.g. Zwiefalten, Bamberg, St Emmeram Regensburg etc.).

It is difficult to say why this antiphoner was copied so late in the sixteenth century. The distinct traces of usage indicate that it was not produced simply as an item for the archives. After the confusions of the Reformation and the reorganization of the liturgy after the Council of Trent, no one would expect such an antiphoner to have been made.

The tradition of the Augsburg cathedral church, represented by Copenhagen 3449 8o, has no similarities with the late medieval tradition of the monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg (D-Mbs clm 4303ff). The later tradition clearly reflects the influence of the “Melk reform.” However, the Copenhagen source has many similarities with the antiphoner in two volumes from Kranj (Krainburg) in Slovenia (Ljubljana 18 and 19). These books were written in Augsburg in 1491 and conform to a large extent with the liturgical tradition of Augsburg cathedral.

It is unknown how the books came to Denmark, but it was probably during the Thirty Years' War. The manuscript was at the Copenhagen Library by 1787.

An unusual characteristic of this manuscript is that, for all antiphons, the first verse of each psalm or canticle has been written out in full and completely notated. These psalm- and canticle-verses, not usually present in antiphoners, have been assigned individual records in this index. These entries have been indicated with "PS" in the genre field (for both psalm and canticle texts); psalm numbers and canticle names have been entered into the addendum field.

The differentiae within each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary only in terms of immediately repeated notes, neumation, or the presence or absence of liquesence have been assigned the same two-digit differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter suffix (e.g. A1a, A1b, A1c, etc.).

Manuscript written on parchment with red borders, octavo format. Brown leather cover, originally with clasps (now damaged), binders in the corners, stamps with gold imprinting. The manuscript is in a good state of preservation aside from the worn covers. The front cover has a Christus monogram with a cross and Corpus Christi, and the back cover shows Maria and Madonna with child (orb and sceptre, Madonna with corona on crescent moon). Important feasts feature rich illuminations, including f. 106r (Visitation of Mary). The text is written in Gothic script with red and blue initials.</description>

An unusual characteristic of this manuscript is that, for all antiphons, the first verse of each psalm or canticle has been written out in full and completely notated. These psalm- and canticle-verses, not usually present in antiphoners, have been assigned individual records in this index. These entries have been indicated with "PS" in the genre field (for both psalm and canticle texts); psalm numbers and canticle names have been entered into the addendum field.

The differentiae within each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary only in terms of immediately repeated notes, neumation, or the presence or absence of liquesence have been assigned the same two-digit differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter suffix (e.g. A1a, A1b, A1c, etc.).

Manuscript written on parchment with red borders, octavo format. Brown leather cover, originally with clasps (now damaged), binders in the corners, stamps with gold imprinting. The manuscript is in a good state of preservation aside from the worn covers. The front cover has a Christus monogram with a cross and Corpus Christi, and the back cover shows Maria and Madonna with child (orb and sceptre, Madonna with corona on crescent moon). The text is written in Gothic script with red and blue initials.</description>

    <description>This manuscript and the other sixteen volumes were created for use at the Augsburg Cathedral. This multi-volume antiphoner is not well-known. It is not included in the recent catalogues of the Danish Royal Library, and so, has been identified with its old signature ("Gl. Kgl. Saml. 3449 8°") from a library catalogue of the year 1784 (Gl. kgl. Saml. = Old Royal Collection). The Catalogus manuscriptorum in Octavo Bibliothecae Regiae (1784) lists this source as "Breviarium in Membrana eleganti, rubris miniatis et litt. init. auro et coloribus distinctis, cont. Hymnos per totum annum Notis Musicis interlinearibus distinctos, ut et Lectiones nonullas (XVII Vol.)"

Copenhagen 3449 8o constitutes the only preserved Office source for the liturgy of Augsburg cathedral; it contains more or less the whole chant repertoire. The printed antiphoner edited by Ratdolt in 1495 (London, British Library, printed book IB. 6753) and some manuscript antiphoners from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries follow the cathedral liturgy but contain principally chants for Vespers. The texts of the chant repertoire contained in Copenhagen 3449 8o are already found in manuscript and printed breviaries of the fifteenth century. These breviaries also contain the texts of a large number of late medieval special Offices (amongst others, for the two Augsburg saints Afra and Ulrich) and responsory prosulae, all of which are found in Copenhagen 3449 8o.

Apart from the profusion of special offices, the chant repertoire is quite typical of south German sources, with analogies to the Hirsau tradition (but with secular cursus). A synopsis of antiphon melodies (cf. doctoral thesis of Robert Klugseder on the chant tradition of the Benedictine monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg) also allies Copenhagen 3449 8o to a group of other south German sources (e.g. Zwiefalten, Bamberg, St Emmeram Regensburg etc.).

It is difficult to say why this antiphoner was copied so late in the sixteenth century. The distinct traces of usage indicate that it was not produced simply as an item for the archives. After the confusions of the Reformation and the reorganization of the liturgy after the Council of Trent, no one would expect such an antiphoner to have been made.

The tradition of the Augsburg cathedral church, represented by Copenhagen 3449 8o, has no similarities with the late medieval tradition of the monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg (D-Mbs clm 4303ff). The later tradition clearly reflects the influence of the “Melk reform.” However, the Copenhagen source has many similarities with the antiphoner in two volumes from Kranj (Krainburg) in Slovenia (Ljubljana 18 and 19). These books were written in Augsburg in 1491 and conform to a large extent with the liturgical tradition of Augsburg cathedral.

It is unknown how the books came to Denmark, but it was probably during the Thirty Years' War. The manuscript was at the Copenhagen Library by 1787.

    <description>This manuscript and the other sixteen volumes were created for use at the Augsburg Cathedral. This multi-volume antiphoner is not well-known. It is not included in the recent catalogues of the Danish Royal Library, and so, has been identified with its old signature ("Gl. Kgl. Saml. 3449 8°") from a library catalogue of the year 1784 (Gl. kgl. Saml. = Old Royal Collection). The Catalogus manuscriptorum in Octavo Bibliothecae Regiae (1784) lists this source as "Breviarium in Membrana eleganti, rubris miniatis et litt. init. auro et coloribus distinctis, cont. Hymnos per totum annum Notis Musicis interlinearibus distinctos, ut et Lectiones nonullas (XVII Vol.)"

Copenhagen 3449 8o constitutes the only preserved Office source for the liturgy of Augsburg cathedral; it contains more or less the whole chant repertoire. The printed antiphoner edited by Ratdolt in 1495 (London, British Library, printed book IB. 6753) and some manuscript antiphoners from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries follow the cathedral liturgy but contain principally chants for Vespers. The texts of the chant repertoire contained in Copenhagen 3449 8o are already found in manuscript and printed breviaries of the fifteenth century. These breviaries also contain the texts of a large number of late medieval special Offices (amongst others, for the two Augsburg saints Afra and Ulrich) and responsory prosulae, all of which are found in Copenhagen 3449 8o.

Apart from the profusion of special offices, the chant repertoire is quite typical of south German sources, with analogies to the Hirsau tradition (but with secular cursus). A synopsis of antiphon melodies (cf. doctoral thesis of Robert Klugseder on the chant tradition of the Benedictine monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg) also allies Copenhagen 3449 8o to a group of other south German sources (e.g. Zwiefalten, Bamberg, St Emmeram Regensburg etc.).

It is difficult to say why this antiphoner was copied so late in the sixteenth century. The distinct traces of usage indicate that it was not produced simply as an item for the archives. After the confusions of the Reformation and the reorganization of the liturgy after the Council of Trent, no one would expect such an antiphoner to have been made.

The tradition of the Augsburg cathedral church, represented by Copenhagen 3449 8o, has no similarities with the late medieval tradition of the monastery of SS Ulrich &amp; Afra in Augsburg (D-Mbs clm 4303ff). The later tradition clearly reflects the influence of the “Melk reform.” However, the Copenhagen source has many similarities with the antiphoner in two volumes from Kranj (Krainburg) in Slovenia (Ljubljana 18 and 19). These books were written in Augsburg in 1491 and conform to a large extent with the liturgical tradition of Augsburg cathedral.

It is unknown how the books came to Denmark, but it was probably during the Thirty Years' War. The manuscript was at the Copenhagen Library by 1787.

An unusual characteristic of this manuscript is that, for all antiphons, the first verse of each psalm or canticle has been written out in full and completely notated. These psalm- and canticle-verses, not usually present in antiphoners, have been assigned individual records in this index. These entries have been indicated with "PS" in the genre field (for both psalm and canticle texts); psalm numbers and canticle names have been entered into the addendum field.

The differentiae within each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary only in terms of immediately repeated notes, neumation, or the presence or absence of liquesence have been assigned the same two-digit differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter suffix (e.g. A1a, A1b, A1c, etc.).

Manuscript written on parchment with red borders, octavo format. Brown leather cover, originally with clasps (now damaged), binders in the corners, stamps with gold imprinting. The manuscript is in a good state of preservation aside from the worn covers. The front cover has a Christus monogram with a cross and Corpus Christi, and the back cover shows Maria and Madonna with child (orb and sceptre, Madonna with corona on crescent moon). The text is written in Gothic script with red and blue initials.</description>

    <description>The four antiphoners Salamanca, Catedral-Archivo Musical, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are the only surviving examples of manuscripts for the Office from the cathedral of Salamanca during the Middle Ages. Written in the 14th or 15th centuries, they clearly predate the Council of Trent in their contents and format, although in general, they contain a number of additions by later, post-Tridentine hands. The numerous additions by a later hand in codices 5 and 6 indicate that these codices remained in use after the reforms of the Council of Trent. While all four manuscripts are in a generally poor state of repair, the situation is at its worst with the two large antiphoners for the Proper of the saints, mss. 7 and 8; here what originally were probably historiated initials have all been excised, with some damage to the following folios in each case. Numerous lacunae exist where certain folios were removed from the manuscripts. The excised initials have been supplied in the file for purposes of searching. The present index reflects the best attempts one can make to reconstruct the original state of the manuscript given the generally bad state of repair of the remaining folios and the obvious difficulties presented by numerous lacunae in the manuscript, in many instances where valuable rubrics or other indications of specific liturgical occasions have been permanently lost. While early documentary references refer to a bishop Eleuterio of Salamanca attending the Third Council of Toledo in 589, no Mozarabic sources from Salamanca have survived. A history of the Salamancan liturgy necessarily stems from the time of the twelfth-century reconquest under Alfonso VI, whose daughter Urraca and her husband, Count Raymond of Burgundy, began the restoration of the city and founded the episcopal see on 22 June 1102. The construction of the cathedral and establishment of its chapter of canons date from the twelfth century. The size of the cathedral and its limitations for liturgical celebration eventually necessitated the construction of a new cathedral; this began on 12 May 1513 and the new buildings were officially consecrated in 1560. Paleographical traits and liturgical characteristics of these four antiphoners indicate that they were used in the old cathedral and may have been gradually replaced once the new cathedral was established for worship and the reforms of the Council of Trent (1545-63) had been implemented in the diocese of Salamanca. These four antiphoners form part of a series of fifty-two manuscripts, all used in the liturgical life of the cathedral throughout the centuries and all currently housed in the Archive of the Cathedral of Salamanca. The contents of the first ten predate the Council of Trent and therefore are considered properly medieval. Manuscripts 5, 6, 7 and 8 are the four antiphoners which belong to this group of manuscripts and thus demonstrate the Proper chants for the Office in use in Salamanca during the medieval period. All chants not found in CAO have been assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;sal&quot;; the differentiae are labelled with a letter-number combination (the letter indicates the final pitch of the differentia, and the number is arbitrarily assigned).</description>

    <description>Toledo 44.1, in its current state, begins with the end of the second responsory for the fourth Sunday of Advent. The first two folios have a portion torn away, leaving gaps in the index where some chants were lost. The end of the manuscript is also missing: it breaks off in the series of responsories for Tobit.Toledo 44.1 presents special problems to the indexer. The text is written by one main scribe whose understanding of Latin appears to have been less than perfect. In many places, the text does not make sense: for example, &quot;t&quot; is frequently omitted from verbs and added to other words, as in &quot;Iba...furiat&quot; for &quot;Ibat...furia&quot; (f. 41r). As far as possible, these scribal mistakes have been corrected; however, in some cases the Latin is so garbled that an intended reading could not be reconstructed.In addition, rubrics are frequently unclear or omitted altogether. In most cases, the correct rubric can be determined from the context; but in cases where there is a series of incipits, the rubrics have had to be reconstructed through comparison with other similar manuscripts.This manuscript has features which indicate that is has been compiled from more than one source. The resulting anthology of chants often has more items than are needed for each liturgical position. This feature is most apparent in the Ferial Office where as many as four antiphons may be presented for a single psalm.The cursus of Toledo 44.1 is mixed.&amp;nbsp; The Ferial Office is organized according to the cathedral cursus with no trace of the monastic cursus except for a few isolated chants. The Offices for St. Hilary and the Invention of Stephen are also clearly cathedral and several other Offices suggest the cathedral cursus. On the other hand, twenty-two Offices appear to be divided into nocturnes according to the monastic cursus. Pentecost has two Matins services--the first according to the cathedral cursus, the second according to the monastic cursus. All Saints&amp;#39; has three Offices, one of the cathedral cursus, one of the monastic cursus, and one which is not clear.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by an &quot;aqu&quot;. Since this manuscript shares a common Aquitanian tradition with Toledo 44.2, the chants not included in CAO that also occur in Toledo 44.2 are cross- referenced by &quot;44.2&quot; in the 131-column version of the index, but have a separate identification number (with the prefix &quot;aqi&quot; and a different number) in the index to Toledo 44.2.Both manuscripts have Offices that are not found in CAO for Hilary of Poitiers (ff. 25r-27r); Saturninus, first bishop of Toulouse (ff. 151v-154r); responsories for Brice (ff. 138r-139r); and a numerical series of antiphons for the Beheading of John the Baptist (added at the end: ff. 178r-178v).In addition, Toledo 44.1 contains Offices not included in CAO for Orientius (ff. 89r-91r) and the Octave of Saturninus (ff. 154v-155r). The Offices not included in CAO for Pontius (ff. 92r-93r), Sixtus (ff. 113v-115r), Arnulfus (ff. 121r-121v), and Quintinus (ff. 130r-130v) are not notated.The differentiae are complete where they occur, but they appear infrequently and are usually added in a later hand.&amp;nbsp; The differentiae are labeled with a letter in the left-hand column of the differentia field; this letter indicates the ending pitch of the differentia (ignoring transposition).&amp;nbsp; When more than one differentia in a mode ends on the same pitch, the second and subsequent differentiae are indicated by a number after the letter.&amp;nbsp; The tonus peregrinus is indicated by &quot;P&quot; in the right-hand column of the differentia field.&amp;nbsp; These differentia names are applied to the same &quot;saeculorum amen&quot; formulas in all of the Aquitanian sources indexed by CANTUS (Paris, lat. 1090, Toledo 44.1, and Toledo 44.2), hence there may be gaps in the numbering.&amp;nbsp; Thus, differentia 1.D in the index for Toledo 44.2 and differentia 1.D in Paris, lat. 1090 refer to identical formulas.&amp;nbsp; (This naming system is not carried over to sources that are not Aquitanian.)In some cases, a lower-case letter appears in the &quot;extra&quot; field to the right of the differentia field.&amp;nbsp; This indicates variations in the differentia, usually of neumation.&amp;nbsp; These letters indicating variants refer only to one particular source, and (unlike the differentia names themselves) are not applied to the other Aquitanian sources to indicate the same variant.</description>

    <description>Toledo 44.2, dating from the end of the 11th century or the beginning of the 12th, is among the earliest Office manuscripts to contain melodies written in transcribable form. This manuscript shares distinctive liturgical elements with the Cluniac house of Moissac in Aquitaine. It also has features that indicate that it is a compilation, with the copyist working from more than one model.Toledo 44.2 contains several chants and Offices that are not recorded in Hesbert&amp;#39;s Corpus Antiphonalium Officii. Each chant not found in CAO has been assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;aqi&quot;. Since this manuscript shares a common Aquitanian tradition with Toledo 44.1, the chants not included in CAO that also occur in Toledo 44.1 are cross- referenced by &quot;44.1&quot; (in the 131-column version of the file), but have a separate &quot;aqu&quot;-number in the index to Toledo 44.1.Both manuscripts have Offices not found in CAO for Hilary of Poitiers (ff. 37r-39r); Saturninus, first bishop of Toulouse (ff. 161v-164r); responsories for Brice (ff. 158r-158v); and a numerical series of antiphons for the Beheading of John the Baptist (ff. 134v-135r).Toledo 44.2 also contains Offices not found in CAO for Geraldus of Aurillac (ff. 149v-152r); and Antoninus of Pamiers (ff. 169v-172r), which is added at the end of the sanctorale. Other chants not found in CAO include a series of Matins antiphons on the feast of Stephen (22v), several responsories for Mary Magdalene (ff. 121v-123v) as well as a series of Lauds antiphons for that same feast that are also found in Sarum. The hymn &quot;Ad cenam agni providi&quot; (f. 92r) is polyphonic.The folios following 92, 100, and 118 are unnumbered; we have numbered these folios 92w (for recto) and 92x (for verso), etc., in order to preserve manuscript order when the index is sorted.The differentiae are labeled with a letter in the left-hand column of the differentia field; this letter indicates the ending pitch of the differentia (ignoring transposition).&amp;nbsp; When more than one differentia in a mode ends on the same pitch, the second and subsequent differentiae are indicated by a number after the letter.&amp;nbsp; The tonus peregrinus is indicated by &quot;P&quot; in the right-hand column of the differentia field.&amp;nbsp; These differentia names are applied to the same &quot;saeculorum amen&quot; formulas in all of the Aquitanian sources indexed by CANTUS (Paris, lat. 1090, Toledo 44.1, and Toledo 44.2), hence there may be gaps in the numbering.&amp;nbsp; Thus, differentia 1.D in the index for Toledo 44.2 and differentia 1.D in Paris, lat. 1090 refer to identical formulas.&amp;nbsp; (This naming system is not carried over to sources that are not Aquitanian.)In some cases, a lower-case letter appears in the &quot;extra&quot; field to the right of the differentia field.&amp;nbsp; This indicates variations in the differentia, usually of neumation.&amp;nbsp; These letters indicating variants refer only to one particular source, and (unlike the differentia names themselves) are not applied to the other Aquitanian sources to indicate the same variant.Because many of the differentia formulas are incomplete, extra fields are employed to record additional information which clarifies the certainty with which the assignment of mode was made. (These extra fields are not included in the 83-column version of the file, but are included in the 131-column version.)&amp;nbsp; The first extra field represents the number of syllables of &quot;Saeculorum amen&quot; for which musical notation is supplied. A letter may follow this number and records additional information as follows:m&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The antiphon melody has been matched with one of known mode.x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The antiphon has been cross-checked with another occurrence of the same chant where the mode is clear.p&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The psalm-tone incipit is provided.v&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The antiphon has a written-out verse which provides the psalm- tone for that mode.The invitatory tones of this manuscript are numbered in the order in which they appear in the tonary at the end of the manuscript. Tones which are not in the tonary are assigned numbers preceded by &quot;M&quot;. The CANTUS names of the invitatory tones are added in the extra field to the right of the differentia field. (Several of the tones in this manuscript are unique and do not have CANTUS names.)</description>

    <description>Les Sources (p. 142) states “avec quelque séquences” aux fętes.”  CMB finds only three sequences in the ms.  There are no sequences for Nativity, Epiphany, Easter, etc, but a general Marian sequence, a sequence for Ascension, and a sequence for Pentecost.  The film used is very faint, and difficult to use in transcription.The ms has no pagination. Les Sources dates as “XIIIr siècle.”  CMB adds “a” for first quarter.  It could even be late 12th c.</description>

    <description>About the AntiphonerThis manuscript, along with the Compiègne Antiphoner (Paris, BN lat. 17436), is one of only two ninth-century sources for the chants of the Divine Office that are relatively complete. Like the Compiègne Antiphoner, it contains the unnotated texts of the chants. Melisma gaps at the beginning of the gradual of Albi 44 suggest that the manuscript may have been originally planned to be notated, a plan later abandoned. In the antiphoner, about a dozen chants contain some musical notation: only one chant is notated in its entirety. Albi 44 has been dated by John Emerson to ca. 890, on the basis of the contents and paleographical and codicological similarities of this manuscript to other sources copied at the old stone cathedral of Sainte-Cécile in Albi at that time. The manuscript lacks any distinctive local saints, and thus the church for which it was copied is unknown. The anthology style of the manuscript is typical of antiphoners of early date: most chants are arranged in series by genre rather than by precise liturgical position. For example, the antiphons for the Sundays after Pentecost are presented in two series, the second labeled &amp;ldquo;de Apostolorum,&amp;rdquo; and although they are more-or-less in order by Sunday (as can be determined from the Gospel texts), this ordering breaks down in several places. Likewise, the responsories for the Easter season are grouped into three sets: on Easter Sunday, on the Octave of Easter, and before Ascension (&amp;ldquo;De Psalmis, TP&amp;rdquo;). Rubrics are inconsistently provided and often added between lines. It is clear that this was a manuscript that was intended to be used by someone who was thoroughly familiar with the Office. Two series of antiphons, on Epiphany (068v13) and the Octave of Epiphany (069r07), have the rubric &amp;ldquo;ad fontes vel ad crucem&amp;rdquo; and may be intended as either processional or stational antiphons. A procession to the baptismal font here may indicate that baptism took place on Epiphany in this church. There is no mention of the font during Triduum, Easter, or Pentecost. In its present state, the manuscript can be very difficult to read due to deterioration of the ink. This is a problem especially at the end of the manuscript.About the IndexThis index was prepared from the edition of the text of Albi 44 by John Emerson, and the edition numbers are entered in the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field (see the File Description) with the prefix &amp;ldquo;e&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Emerson.&amp;rdquo; For purposes of electronic sorting in the index, leading zeros are given for these numbers (e.g. e0001, e0002 etc.). In the Emerson edition, verses of responsories and antiphons take the same edition number as their respond or antiphon. Likewise, a few items were added at a late stage in the edition and given duplicate edition numbers (in the edition 250 bis, 952 bis, 960 bis, 976 bis, 1130 bis). Similarly, two antiphons have been listed in the index that appear only as rubrics in the edition (items e0960, e0977). These items are all listed under the edition number of the previous item, which will present no problems for the user in finding them.Due to the differences in the nature of a text edition and a CANTUS index, this index differs from the information provided in the edition in a number of places. CAO numbers are assigned according to CANTUS principles, and not according to Emerson&amp;rsquo;s critical notes. Thus, texts that are provided with a CAO correspondence in the edition may appear as non-CAO chants in the index. Chants not found in CAO are assigned numbers beginning with &amp;ldquo;alb.&amp;rdquo; Similarly, liturgical position is more narrowly defined in the index than in the edition. Also, the Latinity of the manuscript is highly irregular. As in all CANTUS indices, spelling is standardized, but the grammar and word-order of the original is retained. Users will need to refer to the edition for the form of the text found in the manuscript. Thus, the office designation &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;in evangelio&amp;rdquo;) is used freely in the index, as it is in the manuscript, for groups of antiphons after Lauds or Vespers to be used with either the Benedictus of Lauds or the Magnificat of Vespers (and probably also including some antiphons for general use as well). Three Lauds offices (Purification, and the two offices for Septuagesima: items 070v06, 071r09, and 075r06) are listed with six antiphons for the psalms. This is because it proved impossible to determine which one of these six (if any) represented a duplicate for one of the psalms. Two other differences from the edition should be mentioned: in the edition, Hodie scietis (item e0183, 063r16) is regarded as of uncertain genre&amp;mdash;either an antiphon or a versicle. In the index, this chant is listed as a versicle for vespers, as specified by the rubric. In the edition, &quot;Venite adoremus&quot; (item e1986, 124v32) is regarded as the incipit of the invitatory psalm: &quot;Venite exsultemus.&quot; For the index, a decision was made that this was in fact the second half of the invitatory antiphon itself: &amp;ldquo;Regem cui omnia vivunt, venite adoremus.&amp;rdquo; As most of the chants are unnotated, &amp;ldquo;*&amp;rdquo; appears in the mode column for the majority of chants. &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; in the mode column designates a chant with some notation, however little it may be. The differentia column is not used&amp;mdash;there are no differentiae or invitatory tones in the manuscript.As is customary is a liturgical book, psalm and canticle incipits (including the incipit of the invitatory psalm) are provided with antiphons. These are included in the &amp;ldquo;Addendum&amp;rdquo; field of the index; psalms have been given the prefix &amp;ldquo;ps&amp;rdquo; followed by their Vulgate number, and canticles have been indicated by their first word (or first few words). The canticles that appear in this index are:Cantemus Ex. 15: 1-19Confitebor Is. 12: 1-6Ego dixi Is. 38: 10-20Benedicite Dan. 3: 57-88, 56Domine audivi Hab. 3: 2-19</description>

    <description>Owing to the proximity of Arras and Cambrai (formerly they both comprised one bishopric), there is much overlap in their repertories of Office chant; however, because Arras 893 is a monastic breviary (unlike Cambrai 38 and Impr. XVI C 4, which are cathedral or &quot;secular&quot; antiphoners) it records the Offices in an expanded format. The Visitation of Mary appears in both Cambrai Impr. XVI C 4 and Arras 893. Offices that appear in all three sources include Nicasius, Vedastus, and Catherine. The Office for Catherine is printed in full in Analecta hymnica vol. 26, pp. 212-215. The full texts for the Offices of Aichardus and James may also be found in Analecta hymnica vol. 13, pp. 25-27 and vol. 26, pp. 124-126, respectively. Benedict&amp;#39;s Office appears in Analecta hymnica vol. 25, pp. 145-149.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by a &quot;arr&quot;.Sixteen leaves have been interpolated into the manuscript: they occur between 18v and 19r, 22v and 23r, 29v and 30r, 84v and 85r, 168v and 169r, 362v and 363r (five leaves), 429v and 430r, 441v and 442r (five leaves). The writing on these added leaves is later than that of the main body of the manuscript. These leaves are not numbered. The leaves following 29v and 429v record no chants, but the other fourteen leaves do. Chants found on these leaves are given sequence numbers of 18w (for recto) and 18x (for verso), etc. within the index in order to preserve the sequence order. (The five leaves after 441v are numbered 441w, 441x, 441y, 441z, 442a, 442b, 442c and 442d.) Differentiae are assigned arbitrary numbers.</description>

    <description>Cambrai 38 is a rich source of chants and Offices not found in CAO ; several are printed in full within Analecta hymnica . They include Thomas Becket (Analecta hymnica vol. 13, pp. 242-5), Lambertus (Analecta hymnica vol. 26, 230-3), both Offices for Elizabeth of Hungary (Analecta hymnica vol. 25, pp. 253-8 and 260-4, respectively; the Finding of Firminus (Analecta hymnica vol. 13, pp. 145-7), and the Crown of Thorns (Analecta hynnica vol. 24, pp. 30-4). Because Cambrai 38 and Cambrai XVI both come from Cambrai cathedral, there is considerable overlap between these two sources. Offices that are contained fully or partially in both manuscripts include Corpus Christi, Vedastus, Mary Magdalene, Gaugericus, Augustine, the Elevation of Elizabeth of Hungary, and Catherine. Because of Cambrai&amp;#39;s proximity to Arras (at one time they were under the same bishop), Cambrai 38 and Arras 893 also have features in common; however, Arras 893 follows the monastic cursus, so its Offices do not correspond exactly to those in Cambrai 38. The Offices of Corpus Christi, Nicasius, the Finding of Firminus, and Vedastus appear in both of these manuscripts.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;cam&quot;. Differentiae are identified with numbers chosen arbitrarily; the numbering of differentiae in this file corresponds to that in the file for Cambrai XVI.</description>

    <description>Cambrai XVI C 4, like Cambrai 38, is a rich source of chants and Offices not found in CAO . Offices found only in the former source include Barbara, Furse, Antoninus, Martialis, Anne, Donatus and Amatus (for Offices common to both files, please consult the introductory file to Cambrai 38). Cambrai XVI C 4 also contains lesson tones not found in Cambrai 38: the &quot;Vox dicentes&quot; and &quot;Liber generationis Jesu&quot; lessons and tones for the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Of particular note is the special Office, the Recollectio Mariae, dedicated in Cambrai cathedral by the canon Michel de Beringhen in 1457. The texts are by Giles Carlier, dean of Cambrai, and the chants were composed by Guillaume Dufay. (For more on this unique Office, see Haggh , &quot;The Celebration of the Recollectio Festorum Beatae Mariae Virginis 1457-1987.&quot;)Differentiae are identified by numbers chosen arbitrarily; the numbering system for this file is also used in the file for Cambrai 38. However, there are gaps in the numbering of the differentiae in this file, because not all of the differentiae of Cambrai reappear in this source.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number, prefixed either by &quot;cam&quot; or &quot;cax&quot;: those chants beginning with &quot;cam&quot; can also be found in Cambrai 38, whereas the chants beginning with &quot;cax&quot; appear only in Cambrai XVI.</description>

    <description>This is a very fragile ms, probably will not photograph well,  but very valuable for the melodies.  The book is put together in a very strange way,  for processional antiphons are often intermingled with the sequences,  probably because they were sung by the same cantor(s). Moreover, first sequence of the collection (no. 00) is not even in the sequentiary,   but with a diverse collection of chants for dedicatio ecclesiae.  The book is not a choir book.  It is very small, useful for one singer, at most two.</description>

    <description>About the AntiphonerThis manuscript is one of the earliest complete antiphoners, athough the majority of the chants are abbreviated. From the Basilica of the Holy Savior in the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Martial, Limoges, it was acquired on September 5, 1730, by the Bibliothèque du Roy, along with 203 other manuscripts that were preserved at St. Martial. The date of the manuscript is the subject of much debate by scholars. Some features of the manuscript suggest a relatively early date. Spellings (ae) and letter-forms (the loop over the e; the open a) often reflect an early usage, out-dated even in the late tenth century. In the original layer of the manuscript, the Office structure itself had not yet reached the final medieval form. In addition, the first translation of St. Martial is mentioned (fol. 91v), but not the second, which took place in 994.Other features point to a relatively late date. The gathering formed by fols. 105-110 is a palimpsest, with the antiphoner written over a notated processional. The notation of the processional is diastematic, though still lacking a dry-point line. Thus, the state of Aquitanian notation by the time Paris 1085 was copied was not as primitive as the unheighted neumes (probably due to lack of space) in the antiphoner suggest. Erasures in the office of Martial (fols. 77r-78r) show that the manuscript was still in use in 1029 when Martial was elevated from a confessor to an apostle, but there is no sign of the new office written for him at this time to replace the older, non-apostolic one. Furthermore, there is no mention of the dedication of the new basilica at the monastery the year before, in 1028. Thus the manuscript seems to have dropped out of use about this time. The numerous additions in the text and the margins by many different hands indicate a manuscript that was in use for a long period of time. This suggests a date for the original layer of several decades before 1029, to allow the manuscript to change hands at least once during its working life. An original date in the 980s seems reasonable.The manuscript shows every sign of being copied by a cantor for his own use. Only the responsory verses are regularly copied out in full, while the majority of the antiphons and responsories are abbreviated. One feature of the manuscript is the presense of multiple responsory verses, usually two, for each great responsory. The responsory verses also receive the majority of the musical notation. At every point, it is clear that the scribe was intimately familiar with the material he was copying. Not only are there very few mistakes, but the text is highly abbreviated, requiring a reader who already knows the repertory well. Some of the musical notation is probably part of the original layer, but much of it has been copied later, along with several additions to the text in various hands. Most notable among these later additions are the Roman numerals indicating the mode of the chants.The text of the manuscript is small and often very difficult to read. Furthermore, the manuscript has been bound too tightly so that the inner margins are not visible in the microfilm. The index was checked against the manuscript itself through a Summer Stipend from the National Endowment for the Humanities. For their help and permission to work from the manuscript, the librarians at the Bibiothèque nationale de France are also gratefully acknowledged.About the IndexNearly all of the chants except for the responsory verses are abbreviated. This leads to problems in identification of the correct CAO number. In many cases, these problems can be resolved for responsories by reference to the repetendum cue, or for antiphons because the scribe often includes later words in the chant. (The scribe clearly knew his material and on several occasions takes the incipit just far enough to distinguish it from another similar chant.) In other cases, the reference to liturgical position and to other similar sources may be used to determine the most likely CAO number.Rubrics are sparse, but the layout of the text is clear and consistent, so that in the main text it is usually clear what genre a chant is. However, marginal additions seldom have any kind of rubric, and their genre must be guessed from context. Many of these marginal additions are also abbreviated to almost nothing. Identifying these chants was a major problem, and many of them remain a mystery.Chants written in the margins have been put in their proper liturgical place in the index as much as possible: cues to the left of the location number indicate their actual position on the page:L left marginR right marginT top marginB bottom marginOther letters are used to provide further information:A a later additionX a chant that has been erasedIn the manuscript, the mode for most of the chants is indicated by Roman numerals, including those chants without notation. Mode has therefore been indicated in the index as follows:* no notation and no Roman numeral indicating mode3 notated, mode 33* no notation, but Roman numeral indicates mode 3? notated, but mode unknownr the notation indicates a formula for a short responsoryBecause the Roman numerals and the musical notation are rarely part of the same layer, sometimes they seem to clash. For this reason, the mode of notated responsory verses is taken from the responsory verse formula, and not the Roman numeral mode indicated for the respond. Thus, some responsories have verses in a mode different from that given for the respond. A few responsories have verses in two different modes, each indicated by the notated responsory verse formula.&amp;ldquo;*&amp;rdquo; appears in the differentia column for the majority of the antiphons. 215 items have some kind of differentia, either a notated differentia or a notated antiphon verse. These differentiae are written in non-diastematic neumes, and usually consist of the final two syllables of the formula (&amp;ldquo;amen&amp;rdquo;) only. This makes the identification of the differentiae extremely problematic. In the index, each differentia formula has been assigned a letter followed by a number, which represent a particular series of neumes. In most cases, this is followed in the extra field by a possible mode and differentia name, which corresponds to the differentia names used in the indices of Toledo 44.1, Toledo 44.2, and Paris lat. 1090. A complete table of these differentia formulas can be found in Collamore, &amp;ldquo;Aquitanian Collections of Office Chants: A Comparative Survey.&amp;rdquo; These differentia assignments should be understood as conjectural.In a few cases there is some uncertainty about the Roman numeral designation of a chant. In these instances, the mode field is marked &quot;?*&quot; and the conjectured mode is marked in the second two spaces of the extra field as 1?, 2?, 3? etc.This manuscript is unusual in that it frequently includes short responsories. While it is often difficult to distinguish between a great and short responsory when the text is abbreviated, in many cases it is possible to make an educated guess as to which category the responsory belongs. In cases where it is reasonably clear that a short responsory is intended, a &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; has been entered into the second last space of the extra field.Some of the incipits in the index do not make sense in Latin. These incipits represent the letters that appear in the manuscript as closely as possible, but, because of the great difficulty of reading the text at that point due to deterioration of the ink or careless handwriting, these letters could not be put together into a sensible phrase.Chants not found in CAO are assigned numbers beginning with &amp;ldquo;ssm&amp;rdquo; (Sancti Salvatoris Mundi).</description>

    <description>In this source the folios have been numbered twice, both times in the upper right hand corner of each recto. The index follows the second, smaller set of numbers (generally written to the left of the older, larger numbers), which corrects two mistakes in the other set (f. 34 was omitted and 208 was used twice). Some sections of the manuscript are extremely difficult to read, especially at the beginning (ff. 1-10) and the end (ff. 278-281). In these sections it has been necessary to represent some incipits as incomplete or illegible and to place question marks in the columns that would ordinarily specify mode or differentia. Partial reconstruction of the contents of some of the most severely damaged folios of the source was facilitated by two important editions of chant texts, those presented in volumes 3 and 4 of CAO and those published in Ottosen&amp;#39;s study of responsories for the Office of the Dead (see below). There are clues to the identity of some responsories for Matins on the First Sunday of Advent (notated on folios now missing from the manuscript) in the incipits listed for Matins on Annunciation (f. 160r). Some of the unusual Offices in this source may be found in Analecta hymnica or in other CANTUS indices. The Office for Trophimus, Bishop of Arles (ff. 132r-135v) was edited from a 16th- century printed breviary in Analecta hymnica vol. 18, p. 95ff (LMLO TR61), but is found here in a more complete version including antiphons for Matins, for the psalms of Lauds, and for second Vespers. The Office for Thomas Becket has been edited in Analecta hymnica vol. 13, pp. 92ff (LMLO TH21). Among other unusual Offices are those for Victor, after whom the monastery of St. Victor in Marseilles is named, and his three soldier- companions (ff. 179r-183r); John Cassian, the founder of St. Victor (ff. 186r-187r); Martha, sister of Lazarus (ff. 187r-191r); Romanus of Antioch (ff. 230v-231r); and Lazarus of Bethany (ff. 249r-253r). For certain other liturgical occasions the cycles of chants that are provided resemble those of Beneventan manuscripts (as represented by Benevento V-21, Hesbert&amp;#39;s manuscript L): see, for example, Mary Magdalene (ff. 183v- 186r); and the Transfiguration (ff. 195v-199r). The differentiae are labeled with a letter in the left-hand column of the differentia field; this letter indicates the ending pitch of the differentia (ignoring transposition). When more than one differentia in a mode ends on the same pitch, the second and subsequent differentiae are indicated by a number after the letter. The tonus peregrinus is indicated by &quot;P&quot; in the right-hand column of the differentia field. These differentia names are applied to the same &quot;saeculorum amen&quot; formulas in all of the Aquitanian sources indexed by CANTUS (Paris, lat. 1090, Toledo 44.1, and Toledo 44.2), hence there may be gaps in the numbering. Thus, differentia 1.D in the index for Toledo 44.2 and differentia 1.D in Paris, lat. 1090 refer to identical formulas. (This naming system is not carried over to sources that are not Aquitanian.)In some cases, a lower-case letter appears in the &quot;extra&quot; field to the right of the differentia field. This indicates variations in the differentia, usually of neumation. These letters indicating variants refer only to one particular source, and (unlike the differentia names themselves) are not applied to the other Aquitanian sources to indicate the same variant. Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers beginning with the letter &quot;mrs&quot;.</description>

    <description>F-Pnm lat. 12044 and F-Pnm lat. 12584 are both antiphoners from the Monastery of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, which lies east of Paris, and was reformed by Cluny in the 10th century. Hesbert listed the contents of the latter manuscript in Corpus Antiphonalium Officii, where it is manuscript &quot;F.&quot; The two sources have much in common but, because lat. 12044 is later, it includes material not found in the 11th-century lat. 12584. Lat. 12044 gives antiphons for the ferial Office that match those of the Cluny breviary (F-Pnm lat. 12601). Lat. 12044 contains the following Offices not found in CAO: Babolenus, Arnulfus of Metz (also found in Analecta hymnica, vol. 52, pp. 332-4), Clement (Analecta hymnica vol. 52, pp. 337-40), and Eligius. It should be noted that the Office for Maurus is imperfect: f. 39 is largely torn away, and the chants on that leaf have been reconstructed by referring to CAO. Differentiae are assigned arbitrary numbers.
	
	About the Invitatory Tones of F-Pn lat. 12044
	Invitatory tones are represented in lat. 12044 in two different ways. The first time each of them occurs in the liturgical year, its first section (&quot;Venite exsultemus&quot; through &quot;jubilemus ei&quot;) is written out with musical notation; when the tone appears again, it is given only as an incipit following the antiphon that is intended to introduce and alternate with it. As noted above, several pages are missing from the beginning of the book as well as in a lacuna, and this appears to be the reason certain tones are not present. These tones must have been used with antiphons sung during the first few weeks of Advent, for they are referred to by incipit later on. Among them are the tones called BL, NE, FE, and 2 in the Cantus Database. The repertory of invitatory tones known to the copyist of lat. 12044 is a fairly conservative one: MO and FE for Monday and the other days of the ferial Office, BL for antiphons of mode 2 or of mode 4, for Sundays and various feasts; NE for other, more recent feasts; CH for Christmas and Epiphany; 5 for Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, and some Sundays; 7 for Sundays in Lent, other Sundays, and one feast; PA primarily for week days in Paschal Time, also during the octave of Ascension; 2 for some mode-2 invitatory antiphons (mostly intended for saints&amp;#39; days); and 3 for a small number of mode-3 antiphons. The one unusual feature is a tone that appeared on a page that is now damaged (f. 39r), where its incipit is no longer preserved. Fortunately the tone is given intact in the St. Denis antiphoner (F-Pnm lat. 17296, f. 346v); and this confirms that the incipit that appears nine times in lat. 12044 is in fact that of the partially missing tone. This tone is combined with one antiphon of mode 2 and others of mode 4; the occasions on which it is sung range from Babolenus to John the Evangelist, Peter and Paul, the Assumption, and the Nativity of the Virgin. Tones used with antiphons of both mode 2 and mode 4 in this source are BL, MF, and NE.</description>

    <description>F-Pnm lat. 12044 and F-Pnm lat. 12584 are both antiphoners from the Monastery of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, which lies east of Paris, and was reformed by Cluny in the 10th century. Hesbert listed the contents of the latter manuscript in Corpus Antiphonalium Officii, where it is manuscript &quot;F.&quot; The two sources have much in common but, because lat. 12044 is later, it includes material not found in the 11th-century lat. 12584. Lat. 12044 gives antiphons for the ferial Office that match those of the Cluny breviary (F-Pnm lat. 12601). Lat. 12044 contains the following Offices not found in CAO: Babolenus, Arnulfus of Metz (also found in Analecta hymnica, vol. 52, pp. 332-4), Clement (Analecta hymnica vol. 52, pp. 337-40), and Eligius. It should be noted that the Office for Maurus is imperfect: f. 39 is largely torn away, and the chants on that leaf have been reconstructed by referring to CAO. Differentiae are assigned arbitrary numbers.
	
	About the Invitatory Tones of F-Pn lat. 12044
	Invitatory tones are represented in lat. 12044 in two different ways. The first time each of them occurs in the liturgical year, its first section (&quot;Venite exsultemus&quot; through &quot;jubilemus ei&quot;) is written out with musical notation; when the tone appears again, it is given only as an incipit following the antiphon that is intended to introduce and alternate with it. As noted above, several pages are missing from the beginning of the book as well as in a lacuna, and this appears to be the reason certain tones are not present. These tones must have been used with antiphons sung during the first few weeks of Advent, for they are referred to by incipit later on. Among them are the tones called BL, NE, FE, and 2 in the Cantus Database. The repertory of invitatory tones known to the copyist of lat. 12044 is a fairly conservative one: MO and FE for Monday and the other days of the ferial Office, BL for antiphons of mode 2 or of mode 4, for Sundays and various feasts; NE for other, more recent feasts; CH for Christmas and Epiphany; 5 for Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, and some Sundays; 7 for Sundays in Lent, other Sundays, and one feast; PA primarily for week days in Paschal Time, also during the octave of Ascension; 2 for some mode-2 invitatory antiphons (mostly intended for saints&amp;#39; days); and 3 for a small number of mode-3 antiphons. The one unusual feature is a tone that appeared on a page that is now damaged (f. 39r), where its incipit is no longer preserved. Fortunately the tone is given intact in the St. Denis antiphoner (F-Pnm lat. 17296, f. 346v); and this confirms that the incipit that appears nine times in lat. 12044 is in fact that of the partially missing tone. This tone is combined with one antiphon of mode 2 and others of mode 4; the occasions on which it is sung range from Babolenus to John the Evangelist, Peter and Paul, the Assumption, and the Nativity of the Virgin. Tones used with antiphons of both mode 2 and mode 4 in this source are BL, MF, and NE.</description>

    <description>This index is of the antiphoner section only, folios 66r-78v. About the Antiphoner This manuscript, including the oldest surviving full troper and the oldest extant calendar from Limoges, is of great interest to scholars. From the Basilica of the Holy Savior in the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Martial, Limoges, along with 203 other manuscripts preserved at St. Martial, it was acquired on September 5, 1730, by the Bibliothèque du Roy. The original section of the manuscript, folios 1-98v, is traditionally dated to 933-936, based on the acclamations for Christus Vincet on folio 65. These refer to &quot;Ioanni pape&quot; (Pope John XI, 931-936), &quot;Rodulpho rege&quot; (Raoul, 923-936), &quot;Turpioni pontifici&quot; (the bishop Turpion, 905-944), and &quot;Stephano abbati&quot; (Abbot Etienne I, 920-937). Emerson suggests that the supplement to the antiphoner (fols. 78v-90v), containing eighty-nine notated chants, may date from 935-943, and the incomplete Office for the Octave of St. Martial (fols. 96-97) to ca. 960-980. Folios 97v-98v are largely blank. Six libelli have been added to the original tenth-century manuscript containing various sermons and a Life of Odo, second abbot of Cluny (fols. 144-168), a Life of St. Leodegarius of Autun (155-168v), a Life of William I of Aquitaine (175-181v), a Life of St. Foy de Conques (183-185), and a Life of St. Margaret (189-192v). It also contains a Mass and Office for St. Foy (185-188v). These additions date from the late eleventh or twelfth centuries, but certainly before 1225. The antiphoner certainly does not represent a complete record of the music of the Office at St. Martial at the time it was written, as it mainly consists of antiphons &quot;in evangelio,&quot; with the addition of some other Office chants. For example, Matins responsories are rarely provided. Only the Offices of the Conversion of St. Paul, All Saints (added in the bottom margins of 68v-69r), St. Benedict (with additions in the margins of 66v), and the Annuntiation are essentially complete. Many of the series of chants in Paris 1240 are identical or closely similar to those in Paris 1085 (dated by Emerson ca. 960-980), in both content and ordering. The antiphons for the Office for the Conversion of Paul is very similar to the second of the two Offices provided for that feast in Paris 1085, although the order of responsories is very different. The Dedication of the Church is clearly intended (due to the place in the calendar, October 13) for the church of the Holy Savior, although the church itself is not named. This Office is likewise very similar to that in Paris 1085. The feasts of Saint Benedict (March 21) and the Annunciation (March 25) are out of place in the manuscript, between the Octave of the Apostles (July 7) and Saint Peter in Chains (August 1). (It is possible that the chants for Saint Benedict are intended for the Translation of Saint Benedict (July 11), but the rubric clearly states &quot;In natale S. Benedicti.&quot;) This series of chants is very similar to the series provided for both feast of St. Benedict in Paris 1085. The feast of the Assumption includes many chants more usually associated with Advent. Paul Evans has noted that certain aspects of the troper suggest northern French influence. Twenty-nine chants in the manuscript are notated in Northern French neumes; the rest of the musical notation is in Aquitanian neumes. One unusual feature is the use of significative letters along with the Aquitanian notation.About the IndexNearly all of the chants in this section of the manuscript are abbreviated, with the notable exception of the great O-antiphons. This leads to problems in the accurate identification by CAO number, as the complete text of the chants is not known. Wherever possible, the use of &quot;can9999&quot; has been avoided. In cases where two or more CAO chants have a very similar incipit, the number of the incipit that matched exactly was entered. For example, the antiphon Dixit paterfamilias, was assigned the number cao2305 (Dixit paterfamilias), and not cao2281 (Dixit autem paterfamilias). In other cases, when the incipit was identical to two or more CAO chants, the chant was assumed to be that which appeared on the same liturgical occasion in CAO as in the manuscript. &quot;Alleluia&quot; chants are particularly problematic: there is no way to be certain whether &quot;Alleluia praeoccupemus&quot; or &quot;Alleluia ? (Praeoccupemus)&quot; is actually meant. Finally, in a few cases, a decision was made based on the contents of Paris 1085, a manuscript from the same church, less than a century later. All of these latter cases are indicated in the notes to the index. Rubrics are sparse, and are at times hard to interpret without the aid of the context that would be provided by complete texts or musical notation. For example, &quot;Ad v.&quot; is the usual rubric for Vespers; &quot;Super v.&quot; for the invitatory at Matins. The rubrics (&quot;v&quot;) for responsory verses and versicles are identical--this is most problematic in Vespers where the versicle (if provided) immediately follows the responsory verse (which may be omitted). First Vespers of Sunday is routinely included among the chants for Saturday: on Easter Sunday, the only rubric is &quot;Sabbato Sancto&quot; for first Vespers, with no subsequent rubric for the day of the feast. An &quot;*&quot; appears in the mode column of every entry in the antiphoner, as this portion of this manuscript is not notated. Chants not found in CAO are assigned numbers beginning with &quot;mar&quot;.</description>

    <description>Hourlier believed that lat. 12601 originated at Cluny and was later used in the Picard monastery of St. Taurin l&amp;#39;Echelle. Recently Manuel Pedro Ferreira has called attention to the presence in the source of two different types of neumes--both French and Laon (Lorraine)--that appear to be roughly contemporaneous, suggesting that the manuscript originated in a place in which the two coexisted. He believes that the manuscript cannot have originated at Cluny itself because of the manuscript&amp;#39;s &quot;notational, liturgical, paleographical and artistic oddities.&quot; All chants not found in CAO are assigned an arbitrary number beginning with &quot;clu&quot;. The manuscript contains no differentiae, with only one exception (assigned to the single antiphon written in staff notation, on f. 78r, for Taurinus, which has been given an arbitrary number).</description>

    <description>* * * The manuscripts F-Pn lat. 15181 and 15182, the Winter and Summer halves of a noted breviary designed for use at Notre Dame Cathedral, were probably copied in Paris around the year 1300. The feast of Corpus Christi as well as a few rubrics and marginal chants (e.g. the Responsory &quot;Fluenta evangelii&quot;/Verse &quot;Beatus vir,&quot; and Antiphon &quot;Exiit sermo&quot; for John the Evangelist) seem to be later additions. The index of lat. 15181 follows the modern set of folio numbers in Arabic numerals, in the upper right hand of each recto. This numbering includes 10 folios (a kalendar and some liturgical texts) added to the front of the codex, excluded from the system of Roman numerals in the main body of the codex. The number 401 has been used twice in the Arabic page numbers, a mistake not represented in the Roman numerals. Although a kalendar (six folios in length) was also added to the front of lat. 15182, and was likewise numbered in Arabic numerals, the more recent Arabic numbering system was not extended to the rest of the codex. Therefore, the index of lat. 15182 follows the page numbering in Roman numerals, in the upper right hand of each recto, found only in the main body of the codex. Due to the random addition of a stray &quot;x&quot; at one point, this numbering skips from 168 to 179, a mistake duplicated in the index (in the Office for the Dedication of a Church). In addition, the number 304 is used twice. The manuscripts contain a substantial number of chants and Offices not found in CAO (indicated with an asterisk in the contents of each book, see above). Each chant not found in CAO has been assigned an arbitrary number beginning with &quot;nda&quot;. The breviary also includes a number of Offices in full or partial modal order: in lat. 15181, Nicholas, Immaculate Conception, John the Evangelist, Vincent, and Annunciation; in lat. 15182, Trinity, Corpus Christi, Finding of Stephen, Crown of Thorns, Augustine, Giles, Nativity of Mary, Matthew, Genulf, and Catherine. Along with chants for the Daily Office, lat. 15181 and 15182 prescribe numerous chants for processions and memorials. The processional items, typically a responsory to be sung whenever the feast fell on a Sunday (and would then be celebrated with a procession) but occasionally a responsory and antiphon, are assigned the letter &quot;X&quot; in the Genre column. Rubrics may contain additional information about processions, such as indications about performance practice (e.g. a direction to sing in organum the verse in the processional responsory for the Assumption and the Nativity of the Virgin Mary) and/or routes and destinations of the procession itself. Memorial items, typically an antiphon and versicle, are indicated by the letter &quot;R&quot; in the Position column when the memorial is sung at the end of Lauds or Vespers; when the precise liturgical context is uncertain, or when the memorial is intended to be sung at various times during the season or year, the items are indicated by the letter &quot;R&quot; in the Office column. There are a total of thirty-two differentiae: seven each for modes I and IV (two of the mode IV differentiae appear only in transposed versions); four each for modes III, VII, and VIII, two for mode II (the second of these is employed only with the &quot;O&quot; antiphons of Advent), and a single differentia for modes V and VI. The differentiae have been assigned arbitrary numbers for the purposes of classification. There are twelve different invitatory tones used in lat. 15181 and 15182. These have been identified using the CANTUS system of numbers and two-letter sigla. Although these tones are associated with antiphons in modes II through VII, they are most frequently used in conjunction with antiphons in modes IV and VI.</description>

    <description>* * * The manuscripts F-Pn lat. 15181 and 15182, the Winter and Summer halves of a noted breviary designed for use at Notre Dame Cathedral, were probably copied in Paris around the year 1300. The feast of Corpus Christi as well as a few rubrics and marginal chants (e.g. the Responsory &quot;Fluenta evangelii&quot;/Verse &quot;Beatus vir,&quot; and Antiphon &quot;Exiit sermo&quot; for John the Evangelist) seem to be later additions. The index of lat. 15181 follows the modern set of folio numbers in Arabic numerals, in the upper right hand of each recto. This numbering includes 10 folios (a kalendar and some liturgical texts) added to the front of the codex, excluded from the system of Roman numerals in the main body of the codex. The number 401 has been used twice in the Arabic page numbers, a mistake not represented in the Roman numerals. Although a kalendar (six folios in length) was also added to the front of lat. 15182, and was likewise numbered in Arabic numerals, the more recent Arabic numbering system was not extended to the rest of the codex. Therefore, the index of lat. 15182 follows the page numbering in Roman numerals, in the upper right hand of each recto, found only in the main body of the codex. Due to the random addition of a stray &quot;x&quot; at one point, this numbering skips from 168 to 179, a mistake duplicated in the index (in the Office for the Dedication of a Church). In addition, the number 304 is used twice. The manuscripts contain a substantial number of chants and Offices not found in CAO (indicated with an asterisk in the contents of each book, see above). Each chant not found in CAO has been assigned an arbitrary number beginning with &quot;nda&quot;. The breviary also includes a number of Offices in full or partial modal order: in lat. 15181, Nicholas, Immaculate Conception, John the Evangelist, Vincent, and Annunciation; in lat. 15182, Trinity, Corpus Christi, Finding of Stephen, Crown of Thorns, Augustine, Giles, Nativity of Mary, Matthew, Genulf, and Catherine. Along with chants for the Daily Office, lat. 15181 and 15182 prescribe numerous chants for processions and memorials. The processional items, typically a responsory to be sung whenever the feast fell on a Sunday (and would then be celebrated with a procession) but occasionally a responsory and antiphon, are assigned the letter &quot;X&quot; in the Genre column. Rubrics may contain additional information about processions, such as indications about performance practice (e.g. a direction to sing in organum the verse in the processional responsory for the Assumption and the Nativity of the Virgin Mary) and/or routes and destinations of the procession itself. Memorial items, typically an antiphon and versicle, are indicated by the letter &quot;R&quot; in the Position column when the memorial is sung at the end of Lauds or Vespers; when the precise liturgical context is uncertain, or when the memorial is intended to be sung at various times during the season or year, the items are indicated by the letter &quot;R&quot; in the Office column. There are a total of thirty-two differentiae: seven each for modes I and IV (two of the mode IV differentiae appear only in transposed versions); four each for modes III, VII, and VIII, two for mode II (the second of these is employed only with the &quot;O&quot; antiphons of Advent), and a single differentia for modes V and VI. The differentiae have been assigned arbitrary numbers for the purposes of classification. There are twelve different invitatory tones used in lat. 15181 and 15182. These have been identified using the CANTUS system of numbers and two-letter sigla. Although these tones are associated with antiphons in modes II through VII, they are most frequently used in conjunction with antiphons in modes IV and VI.</description>

    <description>* * * The manuscripts F-Pn lat. 15181 and 15182, the Winter and Summer halves of a noted breviary designed for use at Notre Dame Cathedral, were probably copied in Paris around the year 1300. The feast of Corpus Christi as well as a few rubrics and marginal chants (e.g. the Responsory &quot;Fluenta evangelii&quot;/Verse &quot;Beatus vir,&quot; and Antiphon &quot;Exiit sermo&quot; for John the Evangelist) seem to be later additions. The index of lat. 15181 follows the modern set of folio numbers in Arabic numerals, in the upper right hand of each recto. This numbering includes 10 folios (a kalendar and some liturgical texts) added to the front of the codex, excluded from the system of Roman numerals in the main body of the codex. The number 401 has been used twice in the Arabic page numbers, a mistake not represented in the Roman numerals. Although a kalendar (six folios in length) was also added to the front of lat. 15182, and was likewise numbered in Arabic numerals, the more recent Arabic numbering system was not extended to the rest of the codex. Therefore, the index of lat. 15182 follows the page numbering in Roman numerals, in the upper right hand of each recto, found only in the main body of the codex. Due to the random addition of a stray &quot;x&quot; at one point, this numbering skips from 168 to 179, a mistake duplicated in the index (in the Office for the Dedication of a Church). In addition, the number 304 is used twice. The manuscripts contain a substantial number of chants and Offices not found in CAO (indicated with an asterisk in the contents of each book, see above). Each chant not found in CAO has been assigned an arbitrary number beginning with &quot;nda&quot;. The breviary also includes a number of Offices in full or partial modal order: in lat. 15181, Nicholas, Immaculate Conception, John the Evangelist, Vincent, and Annunciation; in lat. 15182, Trinity, Corpus Christi, Finding of Stephen, Crown of Thorns, Augustine, Giles, Nativity of Mary, Matthew, Genulf, and Catherine. Along with chants for the Daily Office, lat. 15181 and 15182 prescribe numerous chants for processions and memorials. The processional items, typically a responsory to be sung whenever the feast fell on a Sunday (and would then be celebrated with a procession) but occasionally a responsory and antiphon, are assigned the letter &quot;X&quot; in the Genre column. Rubrics may contain additional information about processions, such as indications about performance practice (e.g. a direction to sing in organum the verse in the processional responsory for the Assumption and the Nativity of the Virgin Mary) and/or routes and destinations of the procession itself. Memorial items, typically an antiphon and versicle, are indicated by the letter &quot;R&quot; in the Position column when the memorial is sung at the end of Lauds or Vespers; when the precise liturgical context is uncertain, or when the memorial is intended to be sung at various times during the season or year, the items are indicated by the letter &quot;R&quot; in the Office column. There are a total of thirty-two differentiae: seven each for modes I and IV (two of the mode IV differentiae appear only in transposed versions); four each for modes III, VII, and VIII, two for mode II (the second of these is employed only with the &quot;O&quot; antiphons of Advent), and a single differentia for modes V and VI. The differentiae have been assigned arbitrary numbers for the purposes of classification. There are twelve different invitatory tones used in lat. 15181 and 15182. These have been identified using the CANTUS system of numbers and two-letter sigla. Although these tones are associated with antiphons in modes II through VII, they are most frequently used in conjunction with antiphons in modes IV and VI.</description>

    <description>This antiphoner has several interesting features. The first is the tone for the Liber generationis (21r), near the end of Christmas Matins (cf. Cambrai XVI C 4, 11r). There are three prosulae for the &quot;Fabricae mundi&quot; melismas (19v) and also a prosula for the responsory &quot;Sancta et immaculata&quot; (20v)--all to be performed during Christmas Matins. The Offices for Lupus (ff. 99v-102v) and Paula (ff. 126r-129r) contain responsories that have particularly long melismas. (For a fuller discussion of the melodies of these responsories, please see Steiner, &quot;Some Melismas,&quot; below.) Differentiae are assigned arbitrary numbers. Each chant not found in CAO has been assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;sen.&quot;</description>

    <summary>One part of a two-volume breviary from the church of St. Martin (Tours, France). 13th or 14th century. Staff notation. Cathedral cursus. 592 folios. Temporale ends at Saturday after Pentecost. Twelve lacunae.</summary>

Ff. 582v-592v: Memorials (prayers and chant texts without music) observed throughout the liturgical year, organized by weekday, and text for Martin beginning "Summe sacerdos et vere pontifex" (589r).</liturgical_occasions>
    <description>Tours 149 corresponds quite closely in its organization and selection of chants to the Notre Dame breviary (F-PN lat. 15181). However, its sanctorale is quite limited: the only unusual Offices are for the church&amp;#39;s patron, St. Martin. The commemoration of the return of his relics after the Danish invasion (Relatio S. Martini, 402r) appears to have been celebrated on December 14. The antiphons sung in Matins for this feast, however, belong to the &quot;standard&quot; series rather than the &quot;new&quot; series composed by Odo of Cluny (see Fickett below). The latter may have been reserved for Martin&amp;#39;s Nativity (November 11) or the Translation of his relics (July 4), not included in this volume.Another set of chants (Suff. S. Martini, 441r) was intended to be sung on some days, from the Octave of Epiphany until Septuagesima, as a memorial to Martin. The final sanctoral feast in the manuscript (Subventio S. Martini, 531r) appears to have been celebrated on May 12 in remembrance of the concealment of his relics during the Danish invasion.Half of the manuscript&amp;#39;s ten prosulae may also be found in F-PN lat. 15181 (&quot;Fac deus munda,&quot; &quot;Familiam custodi,&quot; and &quot;Facinora nostra&quot; for the responsory &quot;Descendit de caelis&quot; [cao6411], 78v-79r; &quot;Inviolata integra&quot; for &quot;Gaude Maria virgo&quot; [cao6759], 487v; &quot;Sospitati dedit&quot; for &quot;Ex ejus tumbae&quot; [cao6679], 394v). In addition, &quot;Inviolata integra&quot; has been transposed to end on F instead of C and appended to a responsory in mode 1, &quot;In patre manet&quot; (cao6922), 90v. The end of this prosula is actually the final section of the respond of cao6759 and it is included in both cases. cao6411 is ornamented with an unusual prosula on the Octave of Christmas, &quot;Amplexus parietem,&quot; 92v. Other unusual prosulae occur on ff. 68v, 89r, and 467r.Some of the manuscript&amp;#39;s differentiae are notated in variant forms, necessitating their identification by a system of numbers and letters (for main differentia group and variant group, respectively). Some variants are minor, being no more than the adding of an identical final pitch to accommodate an extra syllable; others, for example in mode 2, are more substantial.Distinctive features of the antiphons for the ferial Office in this source led Dom Jean Claire to include references to it (under the siglum TUR[onense]) in his study of Latin liturgical chant before the introduction of the eight-mode system (see below). According to Dom Claire, the church of St. Martin in Tours was &quot;celebre par sa fidelite aux vieux usages liturgiques&quot; (p. 18). Of particular interest are the Tours antiphons that use Claire&amp;#39;s &quot;timbres&quot; L and N: they end on B but are assigned a differentia that is associated with mode 8. Question marks in the index signify uncertainty in the assignment of mode and/or differentia.In a paper presented on November 9, 1985, at the Annual Meeting of the American Musicological Society in Vancouver, Jeremy Noble identified this source as one of those he had found to contain the melody for the Epiphany Genealogy &quot;Factum est autem&quot; in the form in which Josquin quotes it in his polyphonic setting of this text. This led him to suggest that &quot;both of Josquin&amp;#39;s genealogy motets may have been composed for the French royal chapel to sing at St. Martin&amp;#39;s some time during the late 1470&amp;#39;s, though not in the same year.&quot; (Prof. Noble&amp;#39;s paper, &quot;The Genealogies of Christ and Their Musical Settings,&quot; remains unpublished.) It is interesting to examine the various arrangements of the two weeks before Christmas (ff. 36v-41r) that differ according to the day of the week on which Christmas is celebrated. When the music is notated for the celebration of Lauds during this time (ff. 47v-53v), the absence of rubrics specific to any day require the indexer to select one of the arrangements described above. The first seems the best (ff. 36v-37v), with Christmas on a Monday, because it is the same arrangement in which the music for the Christmas vigil is given (ff. 65v-70r), that is, with Christmas vigil combined with the fourth Sunday of Advent.The church of St. Martin in Tours is mentioned by name in certain rubrics (ff. 1r, 377v, and 582v). The illumination of major initials is lavish for the first Matins responsories of important feasts, including some apparently unrelated scenes in the bottom margin (ff. 72r, 389v, 414r, and 482r). These interesting works of art (for example, among those that survive, a man and woman kneeling in prayer on 389v, a crane- like bird on 482r) seem unfortunately to have been the target of many of the mutilations that the manuscript has suffered (bottom sections of folios torn away: ff. 2, 102, 125, 213, 252, and 264; entire folios missing: between ff. 102-103, 176-177, and f. 239, apparently removed after the folios of the manuscript were numbered). There is also a leaf between ff. 298 and 299 that appears to have been glued to f. 298; only those folios that remain visible (ff. 298r and 298x) were indexed.All chants not found in CAO are assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by an &quot;tou&quot;.</description>

    <description>One group of folios near the end of the manuscript is misbound. The correct order is as follows: 236, 238, 237, 240, 239, 241. In the index, these folios have been renumbered in order to restore the correct order of chants; sorting on the numbers in the &quot;Marginalia&quot; field will restore the misbound order of the folios in the manuscript. The ordering of these folios is also corrected in the facsimile reproduction of the Penpont Antiphoner. There is a detailed codicological analysis of the manuscript in the introduction to that work.The numbering of the differentiae in this index follows that of the Sarum Tonale (published by Frere in The Use of Sarum ). In it, as here, the tonus peregrinus is assigned to mode 8 differentia 5. Six of the differentiae in the &quot;Penpont&quot; antiphoner are indicated by pitches or neumations that are slightly different from those in the Sarum Tonale: these are 1.8, 2.2, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, and 4.2. In addition, two differentiae (4.9 and 7.7) that appear in the Sarum Tonale are lacking in the &quot;Penpont&quot; antiphoner. One differentia in &quot;Penpont,&quot; 2.3, appears to be a variant of either 2.1 or 2.2, but it is impossible to determine which. This differentia is not in the Sarum Tonale.&amp;nbsp;</description>

    <description>Walter Howard Frere used Cambridge, Mm.ii.9 as the main source for his facsimile edition of the Sarum antiphoner. This MS lacks the first part of the Winter Temporale (from Advent to Epiphany), and Frere compensated for this by reproducing folios from several different sources, among them the Erlyngham Breviary. Our index, however, covers only the part of the year contained in the Barnwell Antiphoner. The pagination follows that of the facsimile edition. The numbering of differentiae follows Frere&amp;#39;s, which is based on that in the Sarum Tonale (published by Frere in The Use of Sarum). In this Tonale, the tonus peregrinus is assigned to mode 8 differentia 5, and this numbering is followed in the index. Within each differentia, the compiler of the Tonale assigned each antiphon to a variatio, a group of antiphons that begin on the same note or with the same figure. Frere went further and assigned some antiphons within a variatio to a group (antiphons with similar melodies); most of these groups are discussed in the Introduction to Antiphonale Sarisburiense. Variatio is indicated by a number, group by a lower-case letter. Indications of variatio and group are not included in the Basic version of the file but are included in both the Widescreen version and the printed version of the index of antiphons (see below).Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;sar&quot;. It should be noted that the Office for the Translation of Thomas Becket listed above is incomplete, and is given in incipit only, without music. (Presumably it appeared in full in the part of the manuscript now lost.) The complete text for the Office may be found in Analecta hymnica, vol. 13, pp. 238-42, and an edition of the text and music appears in James Boyce, &quot;Cantica Carmelitana: The Chants of the Carmelite Office,&quot; Ph.D. diss., City University of New York, 1984.Whenever posssible, we have corrected mistakes that occurred in the typesetting of Frere&amp;#39;s original index. Below are some notes for the computer file:Crux fidelis has two melodies: that on page 533 is mode 8, that on 535 is mode 6T.Hodie gloriosus pater (page 512): the differentia is not quite 3.3 but is closer to that differentia than any other.Illi homines (cao3177) is given two differentiae: on page 342, it is 1.5; on page 187, 1.6 (which corresponds to the tonary).In tympano et choro (page 123) is mode 1.2 in the index, whereas the tonary gives 1.1.5 for it.Nunc dimittis (page 404) is 7.3 in the index, while the tonary shows 7.1.1 (this seems to have been erased from the manuscript).Per signum crucis (page 531) is assigned to mode 1.5.6, which corresponds to the tonary; but on page 304 the same melody has mode 1.1.Petrus ad se reversus (cao4284) has two melodies: that on page 468 is mode 1.8; that on page 470 is 8.1.Qualis est dilectus (page 491) is 7T.3 in the index, but 7T.2 in the tonary (this seems to have been erased from the manuscript).Secus decursus aquarum is given two differentiae: on page 538, 4.1 (it appears as if 4.3 was written originally, and then erased); on page 642, 4.3.Solve jubente deo (cao4981) has two melodies: on pages 412 and 464, mode 4.2; on page 470, mode 7.2.</description>

    <description>A note written on fol. 1v in 1361 by a Tuscan priest (as transcribed by van Dijk) indicates that the book was in Lombardy by the fourteenth century:Nota quod ego presbiter Tuscanus canonicus ecclesie sancti Petri et capellanus de Sundrio accepi librum istum mutuo ab ecclesia sancti Petri. submillesimo.ccc.lxj indict.xiij.Frere&amp;rsquo;s suggestion of a connection to the Dominican Order has not been confirmed. Contributing to the suggestion of south German provenance are the Offices of Florian and Gall. On page 309 of Young (1967), there is an edition of the text of the Easter play (beginning Quis revolvit) and on page 690, the rubric describing the ceremony of the Visitatio Sepulchri (72v-73r). The latter is also found on page 900 of Young&amp;rsquo;s The Harrowing of Hell, along with an edition of the rubric describing of the Elevatio Crucis (71v).This manuscript contains some examples of multiple Offices or parts of Offices for individual liturgical occasions. Examples occur for the feasts of St. Stephen and St. John the Evangelist (alternate antiphons for the three nocturns of Matins are given before a complete Matins office), for the Common of Many Martyrs (an alternate set of antiphons for Lauds is given) and for the summer historia De Regum. In this last case, the first of the ferial antiphons (and by extension, probably the entire set) are indicated as an alternative under the rubric &amp;ldquo;alio modo.&amp;rdquo;Modes for responsories are provisional; they are being proposed according to an analysis of the neume patterns found in responsory verses and the modal designations of corresponding responsories in other sources represented in the database. This analysis has demonstrated that the standard verse tones are consistently represented within these leaves by neume patterns distinctive for each mode. Because of their provisional nature, all mode numbers for responsories in the file are followed by a question mark. Where there is any ambiguity (such as in cases where a non-standard tone is given for a verse or where the verse cannot be sufficiently read), a mode has not been assigned.</description>

    <description>The manuscript was likely written in Würzburg between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, possibly at the Domstift St Kilian. It is in three parts: ff. 1-118, a choir breviary, likely made up from an antiphonal from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries; ff. 119-268, a lectionary, thirteenth to fourteenth centuries; and ff. 269-272, additions, fourteenth century. The bastarda script used in the catchwords of the second and third parts suggest that these two parts, possibly all three, were combined in the fifteenth century.

The Abbey of the Holy Redeemer, or St Kilian’s, was a male order Benedictine monastery formed c. 745 by Burchard. The monks had also had control over the Würzburg Cathedral and cathedral school until 786, when Bishop Berowelf of Würzburg replaced the monks with canons and formed the Domstift, the collegiate institution that provided a home for the cathedral chapter. The Domstift was secularized in 1803.

MS. Laud Misc. 284 was donated to the Bodleian Library, Oxford in 1639 by Archbishop William Laud (1573-1645), the Archbishop of Canterbury, as part of a group of over 1200 manuscripts that he donated between 1635 and 1641. Many of these manuscripts, like 284, were originally from Würzburg. Many of the Laud’s manuscripts were given to him by Thomas Howard (1585-1646), the fourteenth earl of Arundel, acquired from Germany during the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648).

The manuscript is written on vellum. The manuscript was rebound in the seventeenth century for Laud with brown tanned calf-skin over laminated pulpboard and three endleaves (two paper and one parchment). Laud’s armorial centrepiece, tooled in gold, is on the binding. The front flyleaf includes a fragment of a notarial instrument by Conrad of Nördlingen, diocese of Augsburg, relating to a lawsuit involving the Dean and Chapter of Würzburg. The folios are numbered in a modern, nineteenth-century hand in pencil, and end leaves in a different, twentieth-century hand.

The differentiae are indicated by letters in the margins of the manuscript, which have been transcribed in the differentiae column of the index. The manuscript does not include a tonary to indicate the associated formulas for these letters.</description>

    <description>The manuscript Worcester F.160 contains a monastic antiphoner, processional, calendar, psalter, hymnal, collectarium, tonary, kyriale, gradual and a fragmentary proser; the antiphoner and processional were reproduced in facsimile in Paleographie musicale 12 (Tournai: Desclee, 1922). The volume includes a tonary of the antiphons that was drawn up by Laurentia McLachlan, who also wrote the introduction.The CANTUS index exists in two forms. One includes all the chants in the antiphoner, processional, and hymnal, including the Offices of the Visitation of Mary and Corpus Christi, which were added in the fourteenth century. (Though not included in the facsimile edition, these two Offices are discussed in the introduction to it.) The location numbers in this version of the index are the folios of the manuscript. A second version of the index includes only the chants of the antiphoner and this version&amp;#39;s location numbers are the pages of the facsimile edition. In the index with the facsimile page numbers, the folio numbers of the manuscript are found in the Addendum field, and likewise in the version with the manuscript folio numbers, the Addendum field contains the facsimile pages.A number of rare Offices for Anglo-Saxon saints occur in Worcester F.160, namely Cuthbert, Dunstan, Oswald, and Wulfstan; texts for the antiphons in Cuthbert&amp;#39;s Office may be found in Analecta hymnica, vol. 13, p. 102. (It should be noted that the Analecta hymnica edition follows a source that presents the secular cursus, so not all the Worcester antiphons are to be found in it.) The Offices for Cuthbert and Wulfstan are briefly discussed by Andrew Hughes in &quot;British Rhymed Offices: A Catalogue and Commentary&quot; in Music in the Medieval English Liturgy, Susan Rankin and David Hiley, eds. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 257 and 279f, respectively. The Office for Corpus Christi also appears in Arras 893.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;wor&quot;. Differentiae follow the numbering of the tonary of the manuscript (as prepared for the facsimile edition) with one important modification: certain differentiae occur both with and without liquescent notes, and these distinctions were not taken into account by the compiler of the tonary. However, they are reflected in the CANTUS index by an &quot;a&quot; added to differentiae with liquescent notes. The differentia labelled 8.5 in the tonary (the tonus peregrinus) is labelled &quot;8 P&quot; in the CANTUS index.About the Invitatory tones of Worcester F.160Invitatory tones are represented in Worcester F.160 in two different ways. All of the tones are written out in full on ff. 96r-99v (pp. 192-99 of the facsimile edition); elsewhere in the source they are referred to only by incipit. The repertory of thirteen invitatory tones includes many standard ones: 2 for some mode-2 invitatory antiphons; FE for use in the ferial Office; CH for Christmas and Epiphany; the tone NE; 3 for a small number of mode-3 antiphons; BL for antiphons of mode 2 or mode 4; as well as the tones named 5 and 7.Worcester F.160 does record one unusual tone, labelled WR, which is used throughout the liturgical year, in both temporale and sanctorale. Although rarely encountered, this tone is not unique to Worcester; it appears in various other sources, even in Toledo 44.1 (though there only as an incipit).The invitatory tones labelled PA and IN, usually associated with Paschal time and the feast of the Holy Innocents respectively, occur in Worcester, but each also has a variant labelled PX or IX. These four tones all occur at the end of the series (98v-99r), and may indicate some confusion on the part of the scribe: the tone IN is assigned to Easter Sunday; the tone IN was originally assigned to Easter Monday, erased, and the PX tone added by a later hand; and an invitatory antiphon sung during Pentecost week (77r; p. 154) is followed by the incipits for the IN, PX, and PA tones. (The PA tone incipit appears only twice, here and after the invitatory antiphon for the feast of Wulfstan.)</description>

	It is hoped that more folios of the Gottschalk Antiphoner (GA) will come to light in time. To facilitate their addition to the extant portion of the manuscript, each folio has been assigned a number based on its position in its original quire. For example, what was originally the third folio of the fifth extant quire is GA folio 53. If the place of the folio in its quire is uncertain, the folios are numbered consecutively beginning with [*]1, where [*] is the number assigned to the quire. For example, although the place of the first two extant folios of the manuscript in their original quire cannot be determined, they are consecutive, and have therefore been given the folio numbers 11 and 12.
	
	It is important to note that while these numbers indicate in some fashion the general location of the folio in the original intact codex, they are in no way intended to indicate the exact original positions of the folios in the manuscript. This system leaves room for additional leaves, while at the same time indicating the placement of individual folios relative to their neighbours.
	
	In the twelfth century, the scriptorium of the Benedictine abbey in Lambach, Upper Austria, was a flourishing centre of manuscript production. Surviving manuscripts of many genres testify to the quality and breadth of the artistic output of the monastery during this period. Of the twelfth-century survivals, however, one type of manuscript is conspicuously absent; no neumed liturgical manuscripts produced at the abbey survive intact. It is, therefore, significant that thirty leaves of a twelfth-century Lambach antiphoner have been identified in various collections. Together, they represent a large portion (approximately one-third) of a liturgically, musically, and art-historically important document.
	
	The antiphoner was produced in the second half of the twelfth century, and was written, illustrated, and notated by Gottschalk of Lambach, the most prolific scribe and artist working in Lambach at the time. Fifteenth-century liturgical notations on several of the leaves indicate that the manuscript was used for approximately three hundred years. Eventually, however, monastic customs changed, and the antiphoner became out-of-date. As a result, when the monastery began acquiring printed books between 1460 and 1470, many of the older manuscripts were dismantled for use as bookbinding material (flyleaves, pastedowns, binding stays, or wrap-around bindings).
	It was during this period that the antiphoner was taken apart and many of its folios used as flyleaves in newly acquired incunables bound at the abbey. All of the antiphoner&amp;rsquo;s leaves bear the scars of this period; sewing holes, shelf marks, &amp;ldquo;ex libris&amp;rdquo; notes, severe trimming, and humanistic marginalia testify not only to the use of these fragments as binding material, but also provide clear evidence of the manuscript&amp;rsquo;s Lambach provenance. Early in the twentieth century, the fragments were removed from some of the bindings and sold separately, either by the monastery before sale or by an early buyer or seller.
	
	Tonary-letters are written in the outer margin on tiers of a column. Several folios (ff. 21, 22, 45, 47, 53, 56, 57, 61, 72, 91, 101, 121, and 131) have been trimmed in such a way that the tonary letters are now partially or completely missing. To augment the modal information contained in the file, the indexers have added the corresponding tonary letters from Engelberg 102, as compiled by Omlin, to the file, in the Extra field (after that for manuscript differentia in the widescreen version of the index). The Engelberg directorium is particularly appropriate for this comparison because it was a sister institution with Lambach in the liturgical reform of Fruttuaria.
	
	In those cases where Gottschalk includes antiphons not in Engelberg 102, tonary letters from the mss. Graz 29 and 30 from the Austrian abbey of Sankt Lambrecht, Steiermark, have been placed right-justified in the Extra field. Sankt Lambrecht was also a part of the Fruttuarian reform and its liturgy, as it is recorded in these antiphoners, is remarkably close to Lambach.
	
	One of the most noteworthy features of the manuscript is the use of tonary letters to indicate the mode and &amp;ldquo;differentia&amp;rdquo; not only of antiphons, but of responsories and invitatories as well. Such usage is apparently unprecedented, and as yet is not completely understood. Neither Engelberg 102 nor Graz 29 and 30 include tonary letters for responsories or invitatories, making impossible a comparison like the one carried out for antiphons. In the case of responsories which could be compared to the readings of Graz 29 and 30 (in staff notation), positive identifications have made some modal designations possible.

For example, although the place of the first two extant folios of the manuscript in their original quire cannot be determined, they are consecutive, and have therefore been given the folio numbers 11 and 12.

To augment the modal information contained in the file, the indexers have added the corresponding tonary letters from Engelberg 102, as compiled by Omlin, to the file, in the Extra field (after that for manuscript differentia in the widescreen version of the index). The Engelberg directorium is particularly appropriate for this comparison because it was a sister institution with Lambach in the liturgical reform of Fruttuaria.

	It is hoped that more folios of the Gottschalk Antiphoner (GA) will come to light in time. To facilitate their addition to the extant portion of the manuscript, each folio has been assigned a number based on its position in its original quire. For example, what was originally the third folio of the fifth extant quire is GA folio 53. If the place of the folio in its quire is uncertain, the folios are numbered consecutively beginning with [*]1, where [*] is the number assigned to the quire. For example, although the place of the first two extant folios of the manuscript in their original quire cannot be determined, they are consecutive, and have therefore been given the folio numbers 11 and 12.
	
	It is important to note that while these numbers indicate in some fashion the general location of the folio in the original intact codex, they are in no way intended to indicate the exact original positions of the folios in the manuscript. This system leaves room for additional leaves, while at the same time indicating the placement of individual folios relative to their neighbours.
	
	In the twelfth century, the scriptorium of the Benedictine abbey in Lambach, Upper Austria, was a flourishing centre of manuscript production. Surviving manuscripts of many genres testify to the quality and breadth of the artistic output of the monastery during this period. Of the twelfth-century survivals, however, one type of manuscript is conspicuously absent; no neumed liturgical manuscripts produced at the abbey survive intact. It is, therefore, significant that thirty leaves of a twelfth-century Lambach antiphoner have been identified in various collections. Together, they represent a large portion (approximately one-third) of a liturgically, musically, and art-historically important document.
	
	The antiphoner was produced in the second half of the twelfth century, and was written, illustrated, and notated by Gottschalk of Lambach, the most prolific scribe and artist working in Lambach at the time. Fifteenth-century liturgical notations on several of the leaves indicate that the manuscript was used for approximately three hundred years. Eventually, however, monastic customs changed, and the antiphoner became out-of-date. As a result, when the monastery began acquiring printed books between 1460 and 1470, many of the older manuscripts were dismantled for use as bookbinding material (flyleaves, pastedowns, binding stays, or wrap-around bindings).
	It was during this period that the antiphoner was taken apart and many of its folios used as flyleaves in newly acquired incunables bound at the abbey. All of the antiphoner&amp;rsquo;s leaves bear the scars of this period; sewing holes, shelf marks, &amp;ldquo;ex libris&amp;rdquo; notes, severe trimming, and humanistic marginalia testify not only to the use of these fragments as binding material, but also provide clear evidence of the manuscript&amp;rsquo;s Lambach provenance. Early in the twentieth century, the fragments were removed from some of the bindings and sold separately, either by the monastery before sale or by an early buyer or seller.
	
	Tonary-letters are written in the outer margin on tiers of a column. Several folios (ff. 21, 22, 45, 47, 53, 56, 57, 61, 72, 91, 101, 121, and 131) have been trimmed in such a way that the tonary letters are now partially or completely missing. To augment the modal information contained in the file, the indexers have added the corresponding tonary letters from Engelberg 102, as compiled by Omlin, to the file, in the Extra field (after that for manuscript differentia in the widescreen version of the index). The Engelberg directorium is particularly appropriate for this comparison because it was a sister institution with Lambach in the liturgical reform of Fruttuaria.
	
	In those cases where Gottschalk includes antiphons not in Engelberg 102, tonary letters from the mss. Graz 29 and 30 from the Austrian abbey of Sankt Lambrecht, Steiermark, have been placed right-justified in the Extra field. Sankt Lambrecht was also a part of the Fruttuarian reform and its liturgy, as it is recorded in these antiphoners, is remarkably close to Lambach.
	
	One of the most noteworthy features of the manuscript is the use of tonary letters to indicate the mode and &amp;ldquo;differentia&amp;rdquo; not only of antiphons, but of responsories and invitatories as well. Such usage is apparently unprecedented, and as yet is not completely understood. Neither Engelberg 102 nor Graz 29 and 30 include tonary letters for responsories or invitatories, making impossible a comparison like the one carried out for antiphons. In the case of responsories which could be compared to the readings of Graz 29 and 30 (in staff notation), positive identifications have made some modal designations possible.

Of the twelfth-century survivals, however, one type of manuscript is conspicuously absent; no neumed liturgical manuscripts produced at the abbey survive intact. It is, therefore, significant that thirty leaves of a twelfth-century Lambach antiphoner have been identified in various collections. Together, they represent a large portion (approximately one-third) of a liturgically, musically, and art-historically important document.
	
	The antiphoner was produced in the second half of the twelfth century, and was written, illustrated, and notated by Gottschalk of Lambach, the most prolific scribe and artist working in Lambach at the time. Fifteenth-century liturgical notations on several of the leaves indicate that the manuscript was used for approximately three hundred years. Eventually, however, monastic customs changed, and the antiphoner became out-of-date. As a result, when the monastery began acquiring printed books between 1460 and 1470, many of the older manuscripts were dismantled for use as bookbinding material (flyleaves, pastedowns, binding stays, or wrap-around bindings).
	It was during this period that the antiphoner was taken apart and many of its folios used as flyleaves in newly acquired incunables bound at the abbey. All of the antiphoner&amp;rsquo;s leaves bear the scars of this period; sewing holes, shelf marks, &amp;ldquo;ex libris&amp;rdquo; notes, severe trimming, and humanistic marginalia testify not only to the use of these fragments as binding material, but also provide clear evidence of the manuscript&amp;rsquo;s Lambach provenance. Early in the twentieth century, the fragments were removed from some of the bindings and sold separately, either by the monastery before sale or by an early buyer or seller.
	
	Tonary-letters are written in the outer margin on tiers of a column. Several folios (ff. 21, 22, 45, 47, 53, 56, 57, 61, 72, 91, 101, 121, and 131) have been trimmed in such a way that the tonary letters are now partially or completely missing. To augment the modal information contained in the file, the indexers have added the corresponding tonary letters from Engelberg 102, as compiled by Omlin, to the file, in the Extra field (after that for manuscript differentia in the widescreen version of the index). The Engelberg directorium is particularly appropriate for this comparison because it was a sister institution with Lambach in the liturgical reform of Fruttuaria.
	
	In those cases where Gottschalk includes antiphons not in Engelberg 102, tonary letters from the mss. Graz 29 and 30 from the Austrian abbey of Sankt Lambrecht, Steiermark, have been placed right-justified in the Extra field. Sankt Lambrecht was also a part of the Fruttuarian reform and its liturgy, as it is recorded in these antiphoners, is remarkably close to Lambach.
	
	One of the most noteworthy features of the manuscript is the use of tonary letters to indicate the mode and &amp;ldquo;differentia&amp;rdquo; not only of antiphons, but of responsories and invitatories as well. Such usage is apparently unprecedented, and as yet is not completely understood. Neither Engelberg 102 nor Graz 29 and 30 include tonary letters for responsories or invitatories, making impossible a comparison like the one carried out for antiphons. In the case of responsories which could be compared to the readings of Graz 29 and 30 (in staff notation), positive identifications have made some modal designations possible.

    <description>This manuscript is one part of a four-volume antiphoner comprised of HR-HF Cod. C, D, E, and F, written by the same scribe. This manuscript contains the first part of the Temporale, from the first Sunday of Advent to the second Sunday after Epiphany. The manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.

Although now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the monastery of Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana Čizmić, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: “TABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].”

A psalter, now also held in the Franjevački Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: “Explicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie. Fratrum sancta marie gratiarum de venetiis. Ordinis obseruatine eximii doctoris sancti hieronymi, scriptum per me uenc fratrem ludouicum ferra eiusdem ordinis professum. Anno domini MCCCC nonaginta die sabb (…).” This inscription reveals the provenance of the psalter, the scribe (friar Ludovico Ferra), and year of completion (1449). While the antiphoner was not written by the same scribe, as evidenced by slight differences in majuscule letters, it likely also dates from the second half of the fifteenth century, possibly also from an Italian scriptorium.

Differentiae are identified within each mode by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g., G1, D2, F1, etc. Minor variations are recognized by an alphabetic suffix, e.g. G1b, A1a, F1a, etc.</description>

The manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.

Although now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana Čizmić, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: “TABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].”

A psalter, now also held in the Franjevački Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: “Explicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie. Fratrum sancta marie gratiarum de venetiis. Ordinis obseruatine eximii doctoris sancti hieronymi, scriptum per me uenc fratrem ludouicum ferra eiusdem ordinis professum. Anno domini MCCCC nonaginta die sabb.” This inscription reveals the provenance of the psalter, the scribe (friar Ludovico Ferra), and year of completion (1449). While the antiphoner was not written by the same scribe, as evidenced by slight differences in majuscule letters, it likely also dates from the second half of the fifteenth century, possibly also from an Italian scriptorium.

Differentiae are identified within each mode by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g., G1, D2, F1, etc. Minor variations are recognized by an alphabetic suffix, e.g. G1b, A1a, F1a, etc.</description>

    <description>This manuscript is one part of a four-volume antiphoner comprised of HR-HF Cod. C, D, E, and F, written by the same scribe. This manuscript contains the last part of the Temporale, from Easter to the Summer Histories. The material in this manuscript follows that of Cod. D; the manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.
Although now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the monastery of Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana Čizmić, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: “TABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].”
A psalter, now also held in the Franjevački Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: “Explicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie.

    <description>This manuscript was reconstituted in the 1950s by Guiseppe Abate from parts of the former Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 693 and Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 694 (see Abate, 1960). A very similar gathering structure suggests that the two manuscripts were copied in the same scriptorium around the same time. An inventory of 1381 indicates that this manuscript (before reconsitution) was kept at the Sacro Convento in Assisi, but its location before this date is not known for certain.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary in terms only of immediately repeated notes, presence/absence of liquesence or neumation are give the same differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter in the first column of the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field.Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers beginning with &quot;fra&quot;. The codes for differentiae and chants not found inCAO in this index are consistent with those used for the other Franciscan manuscripts in the database:Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 694Assisi, Cattedrale San Rufino - Archivio e Biblioteca, 5Budapest, Egyetemi Könyvtár (University Library), lat. 118, 119, 122, 121Chicago, Newberry Library, 24Città del Vaticano (Roma), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, lat. 8737Fribourg (Switzerland), Bibliothèèque des Cordeliers, 2München, Franziskanerkloster St. Anna, Bibliothek, 12o Cmm 1Napoli, Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III, vi.

    <description>The two sources together do not present the complete cycle of either Temporale or Sanctorale. There are two significant lacunae in MS 20 (noted in the catalogue above). Most of the material from the first through the fourteenth Sundays after Pentecost has been lost in the first lacuna and, in the second, nearly all of the unusual Beneventan Office for Transfiguration (6 August) as well as anything between that date and the feast of St. Laurence (10 August). Except for these lacunae, the content of each manuscript is liturgically continuous. However, a significant portion of the annual cycle is missing due to the apparent loss of folios from the beginning and/or end of both manuscripts. The Temporale is complete as one passes from the end of MS 20 (the last Sunday after Pentecost) to the beginning of MS 19 (the first Sunday of Advent). However, the end of Lent, including the Triduum, Easter itself, and the beginning of Eastertide have been lost between the end of MS 19 (Tuesday in the fourth week of Lent) and the beginning of MS 20 (Tuesday after Easter). In the Sanctorale there are gaps between Annunciation (25 March, the end of MS 19) and Mark the Evangelist (25 April, the beginning of MS 20); and between Cosmas and Damian (27 September, the end of MS 20) and Nicholas (6 December, the beginning of MS 19). There are no chants for the Commons, the Dedication of a Church, or the Office for the Dead. It is not clear why the two volumes were bound in different orderings (Sanctorale then Temporale in MS 19 and the reverse in MS 20). This arrangement explains in part the sections of the calendar that were lost at the end of both manuscripts: a modest portion of the Temporale at the end of MS 19 and the larger section of the Sanctorale at the end of MS 20. Kelly has identified several Offices in each of these manuscripts which contain antiphons that are Beneventan or have cadences or other features that are Beneventan in character. These are shown in the facsimiles that appear in Paléographie musicale 21.</description>

This arrangement explains in part the sections of the calendar that were lost at the end of both manuscripts: a modest portion of the Temporale at the end of MS 19 and the larger section of the Sanctorale at the end of MS 20. Kelly has identified several Offices in each of these manuscripts which contain antiphons that are Beneventan or have cadences or other features that are Beneventan in character. These are shown in the facsimiles that appear in Paléographie musicale 21.</description>

    <description>The small size of the manuscript suggests that it was used by the cantor, not the choir. Its precise origin is difficult to determine. It includes both the Germanic spelling “in ewangelio” and the southern spelling “in evangelio” for Canticle antiphon rubrics, and the frequent use of the soft ‘c’ rather than ‘t’ suggests southern origins (e.g., Haec es generacio querencium instead of Haec es generatio querentium). 

The manuscript may be from somewhere close to Chiavenna where it has been since the twelfth century, as there is little evidence to contradict this. This provenance is consistent with the combination of Germanic and Italian spellings and use of Messine (Laon) neumes.

The manuscript is now held at the church of S. Lorenzo in Chiavenna, Italy. They acquired the antiphoner near the beginning of the twelfth century.

Folio numbers were added at a later date with Arabic numerals.

As the manuscript is written in adiastematic notation without differentiae, modes are difficult to assign and have been mostly left out of the index.</description>

    <description>The foliation used in the computer file follows the Arabic numbering found in the upper right-hand corner; these folio numbers are not clearly visible until fol. 10r. Because this is actually the eleventh folio, the second folio is numbered 1w (for recto) and 1x (for verso) in the index. The Common of Saints (ff. 210r-226v) within this manuscript has been bound out of order.

    <description>The contents of Lucca 601 provide some evidence concerning its provenance; as the chants closely reflect the Benedictine liturgy and follow the monastic cursus, it is clear that this manuscript was not written for the chapter of canons at the cathedral in Lucca. Dom André Mocquereau has suggested that the presence of this monastic (i.e. unusable) Office book in a cathedral library can only be explained if there occurred at one time the suppression of a monastery, and if the possessions of that monastery were transferred to the chapter library. This may indeed have occurred in the fifteenth century near Lucca: in an act by Pope Gregory XII in July of 1408, the monasteries of San Pietro di Pozzeveri and San Michele di Quiesa were suppressed, and their property was confiscated. It is generally considered that Lucca 601 was used at Pozzeveri, since this monastery was founded in the eleventh century for canons regular but was transferred to the Camaldolese order (a reformed order within Benedictine monasticism) before the year 1095. Moreover, the ancient library inventory from Pozzeveri lists two antiphoners.The &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field has been used to record the numbers of the melodic incipits of notated chants as found in the facsimile edition of Lucca 601. The &amp;ldquo;Addendum&amp;rdquo; field has been used in a few cases to record additional uses of chants (as indicated by the accompanying rubrics). For example, some chants after Easter were to be sung on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, while others were to be sung on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays (see pp. 231-234).The differentiae have been numbered within each mode following the facsimile edition.</description>

    <description>Lucca, Biblioteca Arcivescovile MS 5 is two manuscripts, a compendium of bishop&amp;#39;s liturgy and other material dating to 1175-1200, and a noted breviary covering the entirety of the church year and common offices dating to &amp;nbsp;between 1125-50. Its liturgy is comprised of a large number of European uses uniquely combined and modified; the breviary also sometimes incorporates the use of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem as it existed prior to its 1149 revision under Patriarch Fulcher of Angoulême. The breviary of Lucca MS 5 most likely represents the use of the Cathedral of Tyre in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.</description>

    <description>The manuscript is devoted almost exclusively to chants of the Gregorian tradition, but there are a few links to the Beneventan musical tradition: the antiphons for the feasts of Benedict, Scholastica, Vincent, and Silvester show some influence of the Beneventan musical style.The ferial Office is organized according to the secular cursus except that extra antiphons are provided for the canticles of the third nocturn of Matins. Chants not found in CAO are assigned numbers beginning with an &quot;mca&quot;.</description>

    <description>The index follows the Arabic folio numbers in the upper right-hand corner of each recto, although damage to the codex has often obscured them. These numbers were added after two groups of folios had been bound out of order in the Sanctorale section: the table below records their correct sequence.1-200: Temporale and Sanctorale to Agatha217-224: Agatha to Phillip and James201-216: Phillip and James to Peter225-273: Peter to Common of ApostlesNo folios appear to have been lost due to this mistake; however, there is a remarkable and unexplained absence of the Sanctorale in the manuscript during the month of July, indicated by the leap from the single antiphon for St. Mustiola (July 3) to St. Laurence (August 10) on f. 231r.The confusion caused by the binding error is compounded by the manuscript&amp;#39;s occasionally unusual liturgical ordering. For example, music for the Exaltation of the Cross (September 14) appears in two locations: f. 202v, following the Finding of the Cross (May 3); and f. 246r, in its expected position. A similar arrangement occurs for music for the feast of the Assumption (August 15): in the expected position for this feast (f. 235r), the invitatory and series of responsories appear to be of northern Italian provenance (with concordances only with Hesbert&amp;#39;s Ivrea and Verona manuscripts in CAO); more widely disseminated chants are included as alternates for the Matins of Assumption but in an unexpected location, following the Nativity of Mary (f. 244r).Some of the peculiar arrangements in the Temporale seem to reflect a relaxed approach to the liturgical assignment of chants or series of chants. For example, antiphons presumably for the psalms of Lauds following the Octave of Easter (f. 116v), but not assigned to any particular day, are followed by a list of antiphons &quot;in evangelio&quot; for the five Paschal Sundays following the Octave (f. 117r), including the Sunday after Ascension.These lists of antiphons are succeeded by two series of Paschal responsories (beginning on f. 120v and f. 123r), separated only by a single antiphon. The only rubric which gives any indication of the liturgical function of these chants precedes the first set of responsories and indicates that some of their texts are taken from the book of Revelations. These responsories are then followed by the feast of the Ascension (f. 125v). (The Common of Paschal Martyrs, it should be noted, has been included within the Sanctorale, f. 221v.)Lack of adequate rubrics makes the assignment of chants to a particular liturgical occasion difficult in other cases, as well. Clusters of antiphons and responsories during the pre-Lenten penitential season are given no rubrics at all: their assignment by the indexers to Septuagesima, Sexagesima, or Quinquagesima is somewhat arbitrary. The same is true for a series of antiphons presumably intended for Eastertide memorials to the True Cross (f. 107r). In order to reflect the manuscript&amp;#39;s lack of specificity, some fields in the index (liturgical occasion, Office, and position) have been assigned very general designations.Unfortunately, water and other damage have rendered many of the folios largely, if not completely, illegible. Faint or invisible musical notation has led the indexers to indicate uncertain modal or differentia assignments by question marks. However, the only folios actually missing from the manuscript are at the end. Some information concerning the missing Common of Martyrs may be reconstructed from incipits listed as alternate chants on the feast of the Holy Innocents (ff. 185v-187v).</description>

    <description>Van Dijk identified a number of saints (included as later additions to the kalendar) that have particular local significance in the southern Italian centre of Tróia, between Benevento and Foggia (van Dijk, 1956, pp. 73-77). However the location where the manuscript was originally copied is unknown.The breviary appears to date (at the earliest) from the second half of the thirteenth century, since the lections included for the Office of Francis (in the main hand of the manuscript) have been dated to the mid-1200s (Armstrong, vol. 2, 471).The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary in terms only of immediately repeated notes, presence/absence of liquesence or neumation are give the same differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter in the first column of the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field (see File Description). Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers beginning with &quot;fra&quot;. The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO in this index are consistent with those used for the other Franciscan manuscripts in the database:Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 693Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 694Assisi, Cattedrale San Rufino - Archivio e Biblioteca, 5Budapest, Egyetemi Könyvtár (University Library), lat. 118, 119, 122, 121Chicago, Newberry Library, 24Città del Vaticano (Roma), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, lat. 8737Fribourg (Switzerland), Bibliothèèque des Cordeliers, 2München, Bayersiche Staatsbibliothek, 12o Cmm 1 (St. Anna Kloster)</description>

    <description>The manuscript is a compendium. It contains a tonary of invitatories (ff. 1-3), a small tonary of antiphons (ff. 3v-4v), a small tonary of mass chants (ff. 149-151), a gradual (ff. 151-228r), a sequentiary (ff. 228v-261), a second tonary of antiphons (ff. 264-267v), and several treatises on alchemy, astronomy and music theory. At least three different scribes were involved in the copying of these portions of the manuscript. All of the hands are twelfth-century Italian. The antiphoner (ff. 267v-450) is complete, and copied entirely by a single hand. (For a fuller discussion of the manuscript&amp;#39;s contents and its scribes, please see the introduction to Glaeske, Piacenza, Biblioteca Capitolare 65, below.) The foliation is inconsistent: sometimes it is stamped onto the page or pencilled in, but at other times it is altogether lacking. The antiphoner contains several Offices that do not occur in any of the sources surveyed in Hesbert&amp;#39;s &gt;Corpus Antiphonalium Officii: chief among these are those for Sabinus, first bishop of Piacenza (ff. 371v-373v); the martyrs Gervasius and Protasius (ff. 387r-389r); Justina, patron of Piacenza (405v-407v); and the Finding of Antoninus (ff. 414r-416r). In the index, differentiae are assigned arbitrary numbers, and no attempt has been made to match this numbering system to that of either of the tonaries in the same manuscript. Each chant not found in CAO has been assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &quot;pia&quot;.</description>

    <description>Despite its long association with the monastery of Sant&amp;#39;Eutizio (in the Vallecastoriana region of Umbria, near present-day Preci, Italy), paleographic evidence suggests that C.5 was originally produced in Rome. The script, a carolina romana of the later eleventh century, and the notation, &quot;transistional&quot; type often called &quot;italo-beneventaine,&quot; both suggest that the manuscript originated in Rome; indeed, script and notation are quite similar to those of the Old Roman Antiphoner (Città del Vaticano (Roma), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Archivio San Pietro B.79). The manuscript appears to have been used by the nuns at San Sisto Vecchio until they came under the care of the Dominican Order in 1219. It seems then to have been sent to the monastery of Sant&amp;#39;Eutizio di Norcia, where numerous additions and corrections were made. Analysis of these indicates that C.5 was revised to conform to liturgical practice of Rome, Biblioteca vallicelliana C.13, a notated breviary containing the Winter Temporale and Sanctorale according to the use of Sant&amp;#39;Eutizio. A catalogue of the first 150 folios of C.5 (accompanied by a catalogue of the entire contents of C.13) appears in the dissertation of Jacob Carl Ledwon. The manuscript contains a large number of chants that are not to be found in Hesbert&amp;#39;s &gt;Corpus Antiphonalium Officii: these include verses and prosulae for CAO responsories, as well as entire Offices not present in CAO. Verses or prosulae associated with CAO responsories but not actually included in that resource have been assigned CAO numbers corresponding to those of their parent chants; the numbers for all other chants not found in CAO are prefixed by &quot;rva&quot;. Differentiae are numbered arbitrarily.</description>

    <description>The manuscript usually includes only the chants for Lauds and Vespers, and the Little Hours in some cases (First Sunday of Advent, Christmas Eve, Christmas, and Epiphany). Christmas is the only feast to have a Matins service (ff. 73r-96v). Therefore, the only invitatory in the manuscript is the one assigned to Christmas, and it is accompanied by a complete invitatory psalm tone (ff. 73r-79r). The indexer has assigned numbers arbitrarily to the manuscript&amp;#39;s differentiae. Only the second differentia in mode 1 seemed problematic: erasures (ff. 12r, 14r) indicate that the form of this differentia was altered by a later hand. Its original form was probably similar, if not identical, to the differentia (1.3) assigned to &quot;Inclinavit dominus aurem suam&quot; (13r), which appears nowhere else in the source. When this antiphon occurs again later in the manuscript (44v), it is assigned the revised form of 1.2, indicating that the editing scribe apparently neglected to change the differentia on 13r. No attempt has been made to represent the erasures in the index. Some antiphons in the manuscript (ff. 14r, 18r, 28v, 35r, 80r) appear to have the mode 1 intonation, but no differentia. This may indicate the second differentia which, in its altered form, is given as A-A-A-A-A-A. The index, however, indicates only that there is no differentia for these chants. Two other antiphons (ff. 130r, 131r) are assigned what appears to be a slightly different form of this differentia, perhaps in a later hand. Probably because there are so few antiphons in the manuscript, three other differentiae occur only once: 4.2, &quot;Sion noli timere ecce deus&quot; (19r); 4.3, &quot;Ad te domine levavi&quot; (55v); and 7.3, &quot;Stella ista sicut flamma&quot; (131v). Comparison with other manuscripts in the CANTUS database confirms that these antiphons are commonly associated with unusual differentiae.The manuscript has no Ferial Office. However, some ferial antiphons--one series for Lauds and one for Vespers (ff. 11r-14r)--are intended to be sung on all week days during the first three weeks of Advent (but not the final week, which has its own proper antiphons for Lauds, according to the rubric on 10v).The foliation in the index follows the more recent foliation (small Arabic numerals in each recto&amp;#39;s lower margin) rather than the earlier one (the Roman numerals in the right margin, which include two misfoliations).</description>

    <description>The latest indication of date in the manuscript is the name of Dominic (canonized in 1232) in the kalendar, in the main hand. Apart from that, no clear indications of date have been uncovered. The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary in terms only of immediately repeated notes, presence/absence of liquesence or neumation are give the same differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter in the first column of the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field (see the Widescreen File Description).Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers beginning with &quot;fra&quot;.The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO in this index are consistent with those used for the other Franciscan manuscripts in the database:Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 693Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 694Assisi, Cattedrale San Rufino - Archivio e Biblioteca, 5Budapest, Egyetemi Könyvtár (University Library), lat. 118, 119, 122, 121Chicago, Newberry Library, 24Fribourg (Switzerland), Bibliothèque des Cordeliers, 2München, Franziskanerkloster St. Anna, Bibliothek, 12o Cmm 1Napoli, Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III, vi.

    <description>In the index for this manuscript, the mode field contains alphabetic codes rather than the standard modal numbers. The system of alphabetic codes used for antiphons is different from that used for responsories and their verses. It is therefore important to take note of the two systems and their differences as outlined below. The mode field for antiphons (and their verses) contains the letter-name of the final (the first letter) and then the reciting tone (the second letter) as indicated by the differentia. This follows a method similar to that used by Dyer (1989) for grouping differentiae in this manuscript. The identifiers in this field employ upper- and lowercase characters to distinguish between registers (capital letters representing the lower octave and lower-case, the higher octave), or at least to establish the relation of pitches to the F- and c-clefs of the manuscript. The series of upper-case letters ends on the G above the F-clef, and thus the series of lower-case letters begins on the following a, through the c-clef theoretically to g (g and f are not actually used as reciting tones).The differentiae in the index are labelled with a letter-number combination; the letter indicates the final pitch of the differentia, and the number is arbitrarily assigned. The order of differentiae given here is independent of that presented by Dyer (1989). The indentifiers in the differentia field also use upper- and lowercase letters to distinguish register.None of the categories in the mode field has a counterpart with a different registral placement. For example, there is a category CF, but not cf, Cf, or cF. Similarly, none of the modal categories for antiphons has differentiae codes with final notes in different registers. For example, the modal category EE has the differentia cateogry, D1, but not d1.For responsory verses, there are eight tones. Responds with the four finals-D, E, F, and G-each have a corresponding authentic and plagal tone. The tones found in B. 79 are not the standard Gregorian verse tones, although they all follow melodic courses similar to their Gregorian counterparts. In the index, the first column of the mode field contains the final of the responsory, and the differentia field contains either AU or PL to indicate authentic or plagal.If a responsory is in transposition, or has a final that seems to contradict that indicated by the verse tone, the theoretical final for the responsory (that is, the untransposed final, or that suggested by the verse tone) is entered into the mode field, for ease in computer sorting. This letter is followed by the actual final as found in the manuscript. Again, upper- and lowercase letters are used to distinguish register. There is one example among the responsories where there might be confusion between two alphabetic codes; both FC and Fc represent transpositions of the F-mode, in the former instance a transposition below and in the latter, above. If the verse of a transposed responsory is also transposed from its conventional register, the code for the responsory is used for the verse. If a verse is not transposed from its conventional register, but has a tone that is inconsistent with the final of the responsory, then the theoretical final of the responsory (suggested by the verse tone) is entered into the first column, and the second column is left blank, as is the case for responsories and verses with conventional finals. In such cases, the responsory and verse will have slightly different codes, since the responsory will have the theoretical final followed by the actual final.Again, it is important to reiterate that although the codes for antiphons and responsories with unconventional finals look similiar, the letters signify different attributes of the two genres of Office chant. In antiphons the first letter represents the actual final and the second, the reciting tone; in responsories with unconventional finals, the first letter represents the theoretical final and the second, the actual final.The responsory verse for the feast of John the Baptist, Hic est enim propheta [for the responsory Praecursor domini venit (cao7420)] is set to the conventional Gregorian tone for responsories in mode 8. Nevertheless, the mode and differentia fields for this responsory have been marked in the same way as the other responsories for purposes of computer sorting.The invitatory tones are numbered in order of their appearance in B. 79. The conventional tone BL, as signified in the CANTUS database, is found in this manuscript and is marked as such. The finals of the invitatory antiphons are entered into their mode fields.The melody-type codes for antiphons developed by Edward Nowacki for his 1980 dissertation have been entered into the Addendum field. These have only been included for the antiphons written out in full.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &amp;ldquo;rom.&amp;rdquo;</description>

For example, the modal category EE has the differentia cateogry, D1, but not d1.For responsory verses, there are eight tones. Responds with the four finals-D, E, F, and G-each have a corresponding authentic and plagal tone. The tones found in B. 79 are not the standard Gregorian verse tones, although they all follow melodic courses similar to their Gregorian counterparts. In the index, the first column of the mode field contains the final of the responsory, and the differentia field contains either AU or PL to indicate authentic or plagal.If a responsory is in transposition, or has a final that seems to contradict that indicated by the verse tone, the theoretical final for the responsory (that is, the untransposed final, or that suggested by the verse tone) is entered into the mode field, for ease in computer sorting. This letter is followed by the actual final as found in the manuscript. Again, upper- and lowercase letters are used to distinguish register. There is one example among the responsories where there might be confusion between two alphabetic codes; both FC and Fc represent transpositions of the F-mode, in the former instance a transposition below and in the latter, above. If the verse of a transposed responsory is also transposed from its conventional register, the code for the responsory is used for the verse. If a verse is not transposed from its conventional register, but has a tone that is inconsistent with the final of the responsory, then the theoretical final of the responsory (suggested by the verse tone) is entered into the first column, and the second column is left blank, as is the case for responsories and verses with conventional finals. In such cases, the responsory and verse will have slightly different codes, since the responsory will have the theoretical final followed by the actual final.Again, it is important to reiterate that although the codes for antiphons and responsories with unconventional finals look similiar, the letters signify different attributes of the two genres of Office chant. In antiphons the first letter represents the actual final and the second, the reciting tone; in responsories with unconventional finals, the first letter represents the theoretical final and the second, the actual final.The responsory verse for the feast of John the Baptist, Hic est enim propheta [for the responsory Praecursor domini venit (cao7420)] is set to the conventional Gregorian tone for responsories in mode 8. Nevertheless, the mode and differentia fields for this responsory have been marked in the same way as the other responsories for purposes of computer sorting.The invitatory tones are numbered in order of their appearance in B. 79. The conventional tone BL, as signified in the CANTUS database, is found in this manuscript and is marked as such. The finals of the invitatory antiphons are entered into their mode fields.The melody-type codes for antiphons developed by Edward Nowacki for his 1980 dissertation have been entered into the Addendum field. These have only been included for the antiphons written out in full.Each chant not found in CAO is assigned an arbitrary number prefixed by &amp;ldquo;rom.&amp;rdquo;</description>

    <description>In the index for this manuscript, the mode field contains alphabetic codes rather than the standard modal numbers. The system of alphabetic codes used for antiphons is different from that used for responsories and their verses. It is therefore important to take note of the two systems and their differences as outlined below. The mode field for antiphons (and their verses) contains the letter-name of the final (the first letter) and then the reciting tone (the second letter) as indicated by the differentia. This follows a method similar to that used by Dyer (1989) for grouping differentiae in this manuscript. The identifiers in this field employ upper- and lowercase characters to distinguish between registers (capital letters representing the lower octave and lower-case, the higher octave), or at least to establish the relation of pitches to the F- and c-clefs of the manuscript. The series of upper-case letters ends on the G above the F-clef, and thus the series of lower-case letters begins on the following a, through the c-clef theoretically to g (g and f are not actually used as reciting tones).The differentiae in the index are labelled with a letter-number combination; the letter indicates the final pitch of the differentia, and the number is arbitrarily assigned. The order of differentiae given here is independent of that presented by Dyer (1989). The indentifiers in the differentia field also use upper- and lowercase letters to distinguish register.None of the categories in the mode field has a counterpart with a different registral placement. For example, there is a category CF, but not cf, Cf, or cF. Similarly, none of the modal categories for antiphons has differentiae codes with final notes in different registers.

    <description>Early 13th century Breviary (pars hyemalis) written in Arras, for the St. James chapel in Namur (dioc. Liege). The manuscript trasmits the Historia of St. Vedastus bishop of Arras (LMLO V11), here adapted to the secular cursus. The proper offices for Matthas (LMLO MG 21) and Maximinus indicate an influence from Trier. Furthermore the Breviary is the oldest source for the Historia sanctae Katherinae "Gratulemur in honore Katherinae" (LMLO CB 29). Evolved Lorrain notation on four red line staff. Cathedral cursus.
The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral.</description>

    <description>This book forms part of the &quot;opus tripartitum&quot; (including a gradual [1536] and a noted ferial psalter [1537] , that the Cologne printer Hero Alopecius (Fuchs) produced for the diocese of Münster after the Anabaptists had destroyed many liturgical books in the city during their &quot;kingdom of a thousand years&quot; in 1534-35. It is a rich source of historia with plainchant texts and melodies that are unique, or nearly unique, to antiphoners and noted breviaries written for use in the diocese of Münster. In addition to the office for St Liudger (Analecta Hymnica [AH] 26, no. 91), the first bishop of the diocese, one can single out the offices for St. Patroclus (not in AH), the Conversion of St. Paul (AH 28, no. 43), the Sending Forth of the Apostles (AH 5, no. 22), the Translation of the Three Kings (AH 5, no. 23), the Beheading of John the Baptist (AH 26, no. 51), Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria (AH 25, no. 73) and the Holy Lance (partly in AH 5, no. 7). All of these offices are part of a work in progress at the University of Cape Town that will include critical editions of the texts and melodies.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO will be retained for the manuscript sources from the diocese of Münster that are currently being indexed.Two breviary manuscript sources, containing the cathedral liturgy of Münster, were consulted in order to clarify Feast Name, Office and Position entries in the index for which the printed Antiphoner provides unclear or insufficient information: Münster, Nordrhein-Westfälisches Staatsarchiv, Verein für Geschichte und Altertumskunde Westfalens, Abt. Münster, Msc. 97 and Msc. 273 (D-MÜsa MSS AV97 and AV273). The Fraterherren of Münster wrote both of these volumes: the former (1464), containing the winter and spring parts, was written for Hermann von Langen, Dean of the Münster cathedral, while the latter (ca. 1480), containing the summer and winter parts was written for a canon of the same cathedral.</description>

    <description>This book forms part of the &quot;opus tripartitum&quot; (including a gradual [1536] and a noted ferial psalter [1537] , that the Cologne printer Hero Alopecius (Fuchs) produced for the diocese of Münster after the Anabaptists had destroyed many liturgical books in the city during their &quot;kingdom of a thousand years&quot; in 1534-35. It is a rich source of historia with plainchant texts and melodies that are unique, or nearly unique, to antiphoners and noted breviaries written for use in the diocese of Münster. In addition to the office for St Liudger (Analecta Hymnica [AH] 26, no. 91), the first bishop of the diocese, one can single out the offices for St. Patroclus (not in AH), the Conversion of St. Paul (AH 28, no. 43), the Sending Forth of the Apostles (AH 5, no. 22), the Translation of the Three Kings (AH 5, no. 23), the Beheading of John the Baptist (AH 26, no. 51), Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria (AH 25, no. 73) and the Holy Lance (partly in AH 5, no. 7). All of these offices are part of a work in progress at the University of Cape Town that will include critical editions of the texts and melodies.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO will be retained for the manuscript sources from the diocese of Münster that are currently being indexed.Two breviary manuscript sources, containing the cathedral liturgy of Münster, were consulted in order to clarify Feast Name, Office and Position entries in the index for which the printed Antiphoner provides unclear or insufficient information: Münster, Nordrhein-Westfälisches Staatsarchiv, Verein für Geschichte und Altertumskunde Westfalens, Abt. Münster, Msc. 97 and Msc. 273 (D-MÜsa MSS AV97 and AV273). The Fraterherren of Münster wrote both of these volumes: the former (1464), containing the winter and spring parts, was written for Hermann von Langen, Dean of the Münster cathedral, while the latter (ca. 1480), containing the summer and winter parts was written for a canon of the same cathedral.</description>

    <description>This book forms part of the &quot;opus tripartitum&quot; (including a gradual [1536] and a noted ferial psalter [1537] , that the Cologne printer Hero Alopecius (Fuchs) produced for the diocese of Münster after the Anabaptists had destroyed many liturgical books in the city during their &quot;kingdom of a thousand years&quot; in 1534-35. It is a rich source of historia with plainchant texts and melodies that are unique, or nearly unique, to antiphoners and noted breviaries written for use in the diocese of Münster. In addition to the office for St Liudger (Analecta Hymnica [AH] 26, no. 91), the first bishop of the diocese, one can single out the offices for St. Patroclus (not in AH), the Conversion of St. Paul (AH 28, no. 43), the Sending Forth of the Apostles (AH 5, no. 22), the Translation of the Three Kings (AH 5, no. 23), the Beheading of John the Baptist (AH 26, no. 51), Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria (AH 25, no. 73) and the Holy Lance (partly in AH 5, no. 7). All of these offices are part of a work in progress at the University of Cape Town that will include critical editions of the texts and melodies.The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO will be retained for the manuscript sources from the diocese of Münster that are currently being indexed.Two breviary manuscript sources, containing the cathedral liturgy of Münster, were consulted in order to clarify Feast Name, Office and Position entries in the index for which the printed Antiphoner provides unclear or insufficient information: Münster, Nordrhein-Westfälisches Staatsarchiv, Verein für Geschichte und Altertumskunde Westfalens, Abt. Münster, Msc. 97 and Msc. 273 (D-MÜsa MSS AV97 and AV273). The Fraterherren of Münster wrote both of these volumes: the former (1464), containing the winter and spring parts, was written for Hermann von Langen, Dean of the Münster cathedral, while the latter (ca. 1480), containing the summer and winter parts was written for a canon of the same cathedral.</description>

    <summary>Liturgical compendium from Our Lady’s church in Tongres (Limbourg, Belgium) containing, among other things, several Offices, dating from the 12th to the 14th centuries. 290 x 205 mm.; 117r-121v, 235 x 160 mm. Hufnagelschrift, several hands. 127 folios. In the CANTUS index, only the Offices provided with music are entered.</summary>

    <description>The Office for Corpus Christi was composed by Jean du Mont-Cornillon at the instigation of Juliana du Mont-Cornillon, founder of the Corpus Christi&amp;nbsp;Office. Barbara Walters among others suggest that Juliana played a more significant role in the creation of the Office than previously acknowledged, citing passages in Juliana&amp;#39;s vita that emphasize her role as intellectual author and editor. Written&amp;nbsp;for the diocese of Liège (1246), the Office&amp;nbsp;was used elsewhere as well. The Office of the Conception is found in&amp;nbsp;Analecta hymnica&amp;nbsp;vol. 5, #12 (pp. 47-50). The Maternus Office is found in&amp;nbsp;Analecta hymnica&amp;nbsp;vol. 28, #21 (pp. 61-63) and LMLO-MF31. The Office of Bartholomew is in&amp;nbsp;Analecta hymnica&amp;nbsp;5, #50 (pp. 148-50) and LMLO-BA81. Most of the chants in this manuscript are not found in CAO.
Any non-CAO chants also found in Tongeren, Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Kerk, 63 and 64 are given the same identification numbers in the Den Haag file, since these manuscripts all represent the liturgy of the same church. Similarly, the differentia codes used for Den Haag are consistent with those of the Tongres 63 and 64; the differentiae are labelled with a letter-number combination (the letter indicates the final pitch of the differentia, and the number is arbitrarily assigned).
	
	The remaining contents of the manuscript, which are not contained in the index, are as follows:
Ff. 1r-39r, partial martyrologium (Usuardus, O.S.B.); 40r-51v, Necrologium ecclesiae S. Mariae Tongrensis (1 January to 10 April); 52r-63v, lections for Corpus Christi and its octave (attrib. Thomas Aquinas, 14th century); 64r-67r, lections for Barbara with a collecta and incipits for Mass; 67v-71v, Feast of Anna (incomplete), containing items for both Mass and Office; 72r-74v, lections and Mass for Conception (no music); 97r-100v, lections and Mass for Dominic; 111r-115v: Vita beati Francisci abbreviata, divided into lessons for the feast of Francis; 122r-127v, lections for Conception.
Boeren (1988) identified these items. Our Lady&amp;rsquo;s church in Tongres is as old as the 4th century, the period of Bishop Servatius. A chapter was founded in the 9th century. At the end of the 14th century the famous Radulphus de Rivo became Dean of the chapter, and subsequently carried out many liturgical reforms, necessitating the preparation of new liturgical books. Therefore, although we possess many liturgical manuscripts from the late-14th or early-15th century, most of the older ones do not survive. Den Haag KB 70 E 4 thus contains Our Lady&amp;#39;s oldest liturgical documents.
	
	Most of the manuscripts of Our Lady&amp;#39;s church are preserved there, including the following:

    <description>Sequences represent late 14th-c. editions to a 12th-c. antiphonale.  The first group (a1-6) are written on 4 folios added at the beginning of the manuscript by a hand using German diastematic neumes, a hand consistent with other contemporary hands from the Utrecht diocese.  The final two sequences (x1-2) are added as single entities at ends of offices by different hands.  The sequence for Katherine may be earlier than the late 14th century.</description>

    <description>Most of the manuscript&amp;#39;s differentiae appear in two or three slightly different forms, indicated in the index by minuscule letters following the main differentia number. Much of the second (&quot;b&quot;) layer of differentiae has been added by a second hand which obscured the neumatic differentiae (in the original sections of the manuscript) with differentiae notated on small marginal staves (ff. 162v-164r, 167v-173v, 176r-178r, 179r-181r, 183v-186v, 208r-228r). The differentiae in the sections added to the manuscript (usually included in the main body of each page rather than in the margin) also conform most often to the second layer, but occasionally are entirely different.Several unusual Offices are found in both the original and added sections of the manuscript. Some have been edited in Analecta hymnica, such as Lambert (26: 230-33), Catherine of Alexandria (26: 212-15), the Visitation (attributed to Cardinal Adam Easton, 24: 89-92), and Adrian (25: 18-21). The Office for Servatius (Bishop of Tongres) in Utrecht 406 is a more complete version of the one edited in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 214-16. Sections of the added Office for Mary Magdalene (146v), not found in Analecta hymnica, also occur in several other manuscripts indexed by CANTUS.Another Office not in Analecta hymnica, for Cornelius and Cyprian, may also be found in Cambrai 38. The Office for Corpus Christi (attributed to Thomas Aquinas) was not edited in Analecta hymnica but occurs in other CANTUS manuscripts. The Translation of Lebuin (or Liafwine, the English missionary to the Saxons of the Netherlands), the Translation of Martin, Remigius (Bishop of Rheims), Gereon and Companions (martyrs, supposedly at Cologne), Willibrord (Bishop of Utrecht), and the Transfiguration are not in Analecta hymnica , Andrew Hughes&amp;#39;s Late Medieval Liturgical Offices, or in other CANTUS files. The literary texts for the Offices for Lebuin and Martin are drawn from sermons of Ratbod, a former bishop of Utrecht.In addition to the six sequences notated on ff. 1-4, Utrecht 406 includes several other Mass chants, either complete or in incipit, most on added folios. The introits for the midnight and dawn Masses of Christmas are indicated by incipit (&quot;Dominus dixit,&quot; 23v; and &quot;Lux fulgebit,&quot; 24r). The alleluia with verse, sequence, and offertory for Corpus Christi have been included on ff. 139-140. For Immaculate Conception (151r), the introit, offertory, and communion have been notated in full, and the gradual and alleluia in incipit.There are also some Mass Ordinary chants (Sanctus, 141r; Kyrie melodies, 141v; troped Sanctus and Agnus Dei, 237v). The troped responsory verse and doxology found on f. 39v is discussed in Helma Hofmann-Brandt, Die Tropen zu den Responsorien des Officiums, 2 vols. (Diss., Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet, Erlangen, 1971), 1: 123-25.Manuscripts from this region of Europe have been described as transitional sources, often having both eastern and western characteristics. For example, some antiphon texts in Utrecht 406 are included twice, with different melodies: &quot;Ecce Maria genuit nobis&quot; (cao2523), 35v and 36v; &quot;Stephanus servus dei quem&quot; (cao5027), 37r and 37v; &quot;Egressus Jesus secessit&quot; (cao2620), both on 74v; &quot;Surrexit dominus de sepulcro&quot; (cao5079), 101r and 101v; &quot;Iterum autem videbo vos&quot; (cao3465), both on 106r; and &quot;Attendite a falsis prophetis&quot; (cao1511), both on 224r. Some responsories in Utrecht 406 have two different verses--on a feast and its octave, for example--sometimes with both a standard and non-standard verse formula: &quot;Centum quadraginta quattuor&quot; (cao6273), 33r and 38r; &quot;In medio ecclesiae aperuit os&quot; (cao6913), 30r and 38r; and &quot;Quem vidistis pastores dicite&quot; (cao7470), 22v and 36r.We would like to acknowledge the help of the offerings of the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum, which made the identification of the manuscript&amp;#39;s music-theoretical excerpts (ff. 228v-233v) possible in less than one hour. The TML can be accessed at http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/.&amp;nbsp; More detailed information about this section of the manuscript may be found in one of the RISM volumes covering music-theoretical sources (see below).All chants not found in CAO are assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by &quot;utr&quot;.</description>

Original layer of the manuscript continues: 152r, Wisdom; 153v, Peter in Chains; 159r, Assumption; 162r, Symphorianus; 162v, Beheading of John the Baptist; 164r, Job; 167r, Dedication of Western Altar; 167r, Nativity of Mary; 169v, Cornelius and Cyprian; 171r, Lambert; 173v, Tobias, Judith, and Esther; 176r, Dedication of a Church (22. September); 179r, Michael; 181v, Maccabees; 183v, Remigius; 186v, Denis; 187v, Gereon and Companions; 189v, All Saints; 192r, Prophets; 194r, Willibrord; 196v, Martin; 200v, Caecilia; 203r, Andrew; 205v, Nicholas.

    <description>Most of the manuscript&amp;#39;s differentiae appear in two or three slightly different forms, indicated in the index by minuscule letters following the main differentia number. Much of the second (&quot;b&quot;) layer of differentiae has been added by a second hand which obscured the neumatic differentiae (in the original sections of the manuscript) with differentiae notated on small marginal staves (ff. 162v-164r, 167v-173v, 176r-178r, 179r-181r, 183v-186v, 208r-228r). The differentiae in the sections added to the manuscript (usually included in the main body of each page rather than in the margin) also conform most often to the second layer, but occasionally are entirely different.Several unusual Offices are found in both the original and added sections of the manuscript. Some have been edited in Analecta hymnica, such as Lambert (26: 230-33), Catherine of Alexandria (26: 212-15), the Visitation (attributed to Cardinal Adam Easton, 24: 89-92), and Adrian (25: 18-21). The Office for Servatius (Bishop of Tongres) in Utrecht 406 is a more complete version of the one edited in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 214-16. Sections of the added Office for Mary Magdalene (146v), not found in Analecta hymnica, also occur in several other manuscripts indexed by CANTUS.Another Office not in Analecta hymnica, for Cornelius and Cyprian, may also be found in Cambrai 38. The Office for Corpus Christi (attributed to Thomas Aquinas) was not edited in Analecta hymnica but occurs in other CANTUS manuscripts. The Translation of Lebuin (or Liafwine, the English missionary to the Saxons of the Netherlands), the Translation of Martin, Remigius (Bishop of Rheims), Gereon and Companions (martyrs, supposedly at Cologne), Willibrord (Bishop of Utrecht), and the Transfiguration are not in Analecta hymnica , Andrew Hughes&amp;#39;s Late Medieval Liturgical Offices, or in other CANTUS files. The literary texts for the Offices for Lebuin and Martin are drawn from sermons of Ratbod, a former bishop of Utrecht.In addition to the six sequences notated on ff. 1-4, Utrecht 406 includes several other Mass chants, either complete or in incipit, most on added folios. The introits for the midnight and dawn Masses of Christmas are indicated by incipit (&quot;Dominus dixit,&quot; 23v; and &quot;Lux fulgebit,&quot; 24r). The alleluia with verse, sequence, and offertory for Corpus Christi have been included on ff. 139-140. For Immaculate Conception (151r), the introit, offertory, and communion have been notated in full, and the gradual and alleluia in incipit.There are also some Mass Ordinary chants (Sanctus, 141r; Kyrie melodies, 141v; troped Sanctus and Agnus Dei, 237v). The troped responsory verse and doxology found on f. 39v is discussed in Helma Hofmann-Brandt, Die Tropen zu den Responsorien des Officiums, 2 vols. (Diss., Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet, Erlangen, 1971), 1: 123-25.Manuscripts from this region of Europe have been described as transitional sources, often having both eastern and western characteristics. For example, some antiphon texts in Utrecht 406 are included twice, with different melodies: &quot;Ecce Maria genuit nobis&quot; (cao2523), 35v and 36v; &quot;Stephanus servus dei quem&quot; (cao5027), 37r and 37v; &quot;Egressus Jesus secessit&quot; (cao2620), both on 74v; &quot;Surrexit dominus de sepulcro&quot; (cao5079), 101r and 101v; &quot;Iterum autem videbo vos&quot; (cao3465), both on 106r; and &quot;Attendite a falsis prophetis&quot; (cao1511), both on 224r. Some responsories in Utrecht 406 have two different verses--on a feast and its octave, for example--sometimes with both a standard and non-standard verse formula: &quot;Centum quadraginta quattuor&quot; (cao6273), 33r and 38r; &quot;In medio ecclesiae aperuit os&quot; (cao6913), 30r and 38r; and &quot;Quem vidistis pastores dicite&quot; (cao7470), 22v and 36r.We would like to acknowledge the help of the offerings of the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum, which made the identification of the manuscript&amp;#39;s music-theoretical excerpts (ff. 228v-233v) possible in less than one hour. The TML can be accessed at http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/.&amp;nbsp; More detailed information about this section of the manuscript may be found in one of the RISM volumes covering music-theoretical sources (see below).All chants not found in CAO are assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by &quot;utr&quot;.</description>

Ff. 208r-222r: Common of Saints (220r, special Common of Virgins). Ff. 222v-228r: Sundays after Pentecost. Ff. 228v-233v: Sections of various theoretical treatises (Guido's Micrologus, Chapters 12-13; Pseudo-Guido's Prologus in Antiphonarium, almost complete; Regino of Pruem's Tonarius, first section; Odo's Dialogus, interspersed with a partially notated tonary, ascribed to Berno, of Mass and Office chants).

    <description>Most of the manuscript&amp;#39;s differentiae appear in two or three slightly different forms, indicated in the index by minuscule letters following the main differentia number. Much of the second (&quot;b&quot;) layer of differentiae has been added by a second hand which obscured the neumatic differentiae (in the original sections of the manuscript) with differentiae notated on small marginal staves (ff. 162v-164r, 167v-173v, 176r-178r, 179r-181r, 183v-186v, 208r-228r). The differentiae in the sections added to the manuscript (usually included in the main body of each page rather than in the margin) also conform most often to the second layer, but occasionally are entirely different.Several unusual Offices are found in both the original and added sections of the manuscript. Some have been edited in Analecta hymnica, such as Lambert (26: 230-33), Catherine of Alexandria (26: 212-15), the Visitation (attributed to Cardinal Adam Easton, 24: 89-92), and Adrian (25: 18-21). The Office for Servatius (Bishop of Tongres) in Utrecht 406 is a more complete version of the one edited in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 214-16. Sections of the added Office for Mary Magdalene (146v), not found in Analecta hymnica, also occur in several other manuscripts indexed by CANTUS.Another Office not in Analecta hymnica, for Cornelius and Cyprian, may also be found in Cambrai 38. The Office for Corpus Christi (attributed to Thomas Aquinas) was not edited in Analecta hymnica but occurs in other CANTUS manuscripts. The Translation of Lebuin (or Liafwine, the English missionary to the Saxons of the Netherlands), the Translation of Martin, Remigius (Bishop of Rheims), Gereon and Companions (martyrs, supposedly at Cologne), Willibrord (Bishop of Utrecht), and the Transfiguration are not in Analecta hymnica , Andrew Hughes&amp;#39;s Late Medieval Liturgical Offices, or in other CANTUS files. The literary texts for the Offices for Lebuin and Martin are drawn from sermons of Ratbod, a former bishop of Utrecht.In addition to the six sequences notated on ff. 1-4, Utrecht 406 includes several other Mass chants, either complete or in incipit, most on added folios. The introits for the midnight and dawn Masses of Christmas are indicated by incipit (&quot;Dominus dixit,&quot; 23v; and &quot;Lux fulgebit,&quot; 24r). The alleluia with verse, sequence, and offertory for Corpus Christi have been included on ff. 139-140. For Immaculate Conception (151r), the introit, offertory, and communion have been notated in full, and the gradual and alleluia in incipit.There are also some Mass Ordinary chants (Sanctus, 141r; Kyrie melodies, 141v; troped Sanctus and Agnus Dei, 237v). The troped responsory verse and doxology found on f. 39v is discussed in Helma Hofmann-Brandt, Die Tropen zu den Responsorien des Officiums, 2 vols. (Diss., Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet, Erlangen, 1971), 1: 123-25.Manuscripts from this region of Europe have been described as transitional sources, often having both eastern and western characteristics. For example, some antiphon texts in Utrecht 406 are included twice, with different melodies: &quot;Ecce Maria genuit nobis&quot; (cao2523), 35v and 36v; &quot;Stephanus servus dei quem&quot; (cao5027), 37r and 37v; &quot;Egressus Jesus secessit&quot; (cao2620), both on 74v; &quot;Surrexit dominus de sepulcro&quot; (cao5079), 101r and 101v; &quot;Iterum autem videbo vos&quot; (cao3465), both on 106r; and &quot;Attendite a falsis prophetis&quot; (cao1511), both on 224r. Some responsories in Utrecht 406 have two different verses--on a feast and its octave, for example--sometimes with both a standard and non-standard verse formula: &quot;Centum quadraginta quattuor&quot; (cao6273), 33r and 38r; &quot;In medio ecclesiae aperuit os&quot; (cao6913), 30r and 38r; and &quot;Quem vidistis pastores dicite&quot; (cao7470), 22v and 36r.We would like to acknowledge the help of the offerings of the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum, which made the identification of the manuscript&amp;#39;s music-theoretical excerpts (ff. 228v-233v) possible in less than one hour. The TML can be accessed at http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/.&amp;nbsp; More detailed information about this section of the manuscript may be found in one of the RISM volumes covering music-theoretical sources (see below).All chants not found in CAO are assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by &quot;utr&quot;.</description>

Ff. 234-256: Section of folios appended to the manuscript. 234r, Catherine of Alexandria; 238r, Transfiguration (copied twice, also on 248r-251v); 243r, Visitation of Mary; 251v, Adrian.</liturgical_occasions>
    <description>Most of the manuscript&amp;#39;s differentiae appear in two or three slightly different forms, indicated in the index by minuscule letters following the main differentia number. Much of the second (&quot;b&quot;) layer of differentiae has been added by a second hand which obscured the neumatic differentiae (in the original sections of the manuscript) with differentiae notated on small marginal staves (ff. 162v-164r, 167v-173v, 176r-178r, 179r-181r, 183v-186v, 208r-228r). The differentiae in the sections added to the manuscript (usually included in the main body of each page rather than in the margin) also conform most often to the second layer, but occasionally are entirely different.Several unusual Offices are found in both the original and added sections of the manuscript. Some have been edited in Analecta hymnica, such as Lambert (26: 230-33), Catherine of Alexandria (26: 212-15), the Visitation (attributed to Cardinal Adam Easton, 24: 89-92), and Adrian (25: 18-21). The Office for Servatius (Bishop of Tongres) in Utrecht 406 is a more complete version of the one edited in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 214-16. Sections of the added Office for Mary Magdalene (146v), not found in Analecta hymnica, also occur in several other manuscripts indexed by CANTUS.Another Office not in Analecta hymnica, for Cornelius and Cyprian, may also be found in Cambrai 38. The Office for Corpus Christi (attributed to Thomas Aquinas) was not edited in Analecta hymnica but occurs in other CANTUS manuscripts. The Translation of Lebuin (or Liafwine, the English missionary to the Saxons of the Netherlands), the Translation of Martin, Remigius (Bishop of Rheims), Gereon and Companions (martyrs, supposedly at Cologne), Willibrord (Bishop of Utrecht), and the Transfiguration are not in Analecta hymnica , Andrew Hughes&amp;#39;s Late Medieval Liturgical Offices, or in other CANTUS files. The literary texts for the Offices for Lebuin and Martin are drawn from sermons of Ratbod, a former bishop of Utrecht.In addition to the six sequences notated on ff. 1-4, Utrecht 406 includes several other Mass chants, either complete or in incipit, most on added folios. The introits for the midnight and dawn Masses of Christmas are indicated by incipit (&quot;Dominus dixit,&quot; 23v; and &quot;Lux fulgebit,&quot; 24r). The alleluia with verse, sequence, and offertory for Corpus Christi have been included on ff. 139-140. For Immaculate Conception (151r), the introit, offertory, and communion have been notated in full, and the gradual and alleluia in incipit.There are also some Mass Ordinary chants (Sanctus, 141r; Kyrie melodies, 141v; troped Sanctus and Agnus Dei, 237v). The troped responsory verse and doxology found on f. 39v is discussed in Helma Hofmann-Brandt, Die Tropen zu den Responsorien des Officiums, 2 vols. (Diss., Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet, Erlangen, 1971), 1: 123-25.Manuscripts from this region of Europe have been described as transitional sources, often having both eastern and western characteristics. For example, some antiphon texts in Utrecht 406 are included twice, with different melodies: &quot;Ecce Maria genuit nobis&quot; (cao2523), 35v and 36v; &quot;Stephanus servus dei quem&quot; (cao5027), 37r and 37v; &quot;Egressus Jesus secessit&quot; (cao2620), both on 74v; &quot;Surrexit dominus de sepulcro&quot; (cao5079), 101r and 101v; &quot;Iterum autem videbo vos&quot; (cao3465), both on 106r; and &quot;Attendite a falsis prophetis&quot; (cao1511), both on 224r. Some responsories in Utrecht 406 have two different verses--on a feast and its octave, for example--sometimes with both a standard and non-standard verse formula: &quot;Centum quadraginta quattuor&quot; (cao6273), 33r and 38r; &quot;In medio ecclesiae aperuit os&quot; (cao6913), 30r and 38r; and &quot;Quem vidistis pastores dicite&quot; (cao7470), 22v and 36r.We would like to acknowledge the help of the offerings of the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum, which made the identification of the manuscript&amp;#39;s music-theoretical excerpts (ff. 228v-233v) possible in less than one hour. The TML can be accessed at http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/.&amp;nbsp; More detailed information about this section of the manuscript may be found in one of the RISM volumes covering music-theoretical sources (see below).All chants not found in CAO are assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by &quot;utr&quot;.</description>

    <description>Some Offices are found in the volumes of Analecta hymnicaPresentation of Mary, in Analecta hymnica vol. 24, pp. 76-80; Holy Lance, partly in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 35-36, cf. Vorau; Visitation of Mary, in Analecta hymnica vol. 24, pp. 89-94; Anna, partly in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 115-117; Gudula - The Office from the Brussels Gudula Church, partly in Analecta hymnica vol. 26, pp. 78-79; Elizabeth of Hungary, in Analecta hymnica vol. 25, pp. 253-258, cf Cambrai; Francis of Assisi, in Analecta hymnica vol. 5, pp. 175-178, cf. Budapest; Justus, in Analecta hymnica vol. 55, pp. 404-408.Many of the Offices in the 16th-century portion of the manuscript received their place in the Zutphen liturgy in the later Middle Ages. The manuscript contains an Office of Gudula, partly known from sources of Brussels. A church was dedicated to this saint in the village of Lochem, a church under the control of the Zutphen chapter. The Justus Office reflects veneration for Justus during the 15th century, a veneration which also led to the founding of a Confraternity for Ewald and Justus in 1454. Relics of Justus of Beauvais had been preserved in Zutphen since at least the 14th century; and an additional relic for the saint was brought by the Franciscans when they established themselves in Zutphen, around 1450. The settling of the Franciscans at this time also explains the occurence of a Francis Office in the later additions to the MS.&amp;nbsp; Other relics were kept in Zutphen as well, including the bones of Bartholomew and some skulls of the 11, 000 virgins.&amp;nbsp; These relics were taken out of Zutphen during the religious troubles at the end of the 16th century and brought to Antwerp.Among the 15th century portions of the MS we find:An Office for Walburga, patron saint of the church. This Office is a compilation of chants, written originally for Walburga or for other female saints (some chants are found in the Office of Gertrudis of Nivelles, Analecta hymnica vol. 26, pp. 60-63).The relatively extended Office for Margaret in the 15th century part of the MS (in prose; with psalm quotations in some of the chants; not in Analecta hynnica or LMLO) can perhaps be explained by the fact that in St. Walburga&amp;#39;s was a Margaret chapel; this was the chapel of the counts of Zutphen.The Bartholomew Office is not in Analecta hymnica; some chants can be found in LMLO (BA84 and BA85).In the Zutphen tradition, some saints are celebrated on idiosyncratic dates.&amp;nbsp; According to all Zutphen sources, the translation of Walburga&amp;#39;s relics to Eichstätt is celebrated on 24 September, while in Eichstätt (where she is buried together with her brother) it is celebrated on 12 October.&amp;nbsp; The translation of Gudula is in Zutphen on 8 October, but in Brussels (where her relics were brought in the 11th century and where her Office originated) on 6 July.&amp;nbsp; Justus of Beauvais is celebrated in Zutphen on 11 October, though his feast is traditionally 18 October.&amp;nbsp; Apparently Justus of Beauvais was confused with Justus of Arras.Although Zutphen is now a relatively small city in the east of the Netherlands, it was a flourishing town during the Middle Ages, the residence of the counts of both Zutphen and the county (from 1339 onwards duchy) Gelre.The chapter of Zutphen was founded in the 11th century, and consisted of a provost and 12 canons; there were 11-16 vicars and in 15th-century documents 3 &quot;chorisocii&quot; are mentioned.&amp;nbsp; In addition, there were also schoolboys.&amp;nbsp; The church is connected with the famous &quot;Librije&quot;, a unique late medieval library built adjacent to the church.The presence of an organ is known from the first half of the 15th century onwards.&amp;nbsp; No traces of polyphonic vocal music are known.Most of the books and documents of the chapter are kept in the Municipal Archive (the Stadsarchief or Gemeentelijk Archief Zutphen). Some are in the Librije or elsewhere.Other sources for the Zutphen Office are:Breviarium festivum (Brussels, Bibl. Bollandistes, ms 680), prepared ca. 1470 (without notation).Two choir books (Zutphen, GAZ, ms 2 and Zutphen, Librije, ms 6), dating from the 2nd half of the 15th century, partly early 16th century, each containing a limited number of Offices, and some sequences. The books are identical and apparently meant for both sides of the choir.A&amp;nbsp; small 15th century book with the responsoria brevia (Zutphen, Librije, ms 5)For the Mass, unnoted missals have generally survived; only some sequences (e.g. for Walburga) are preserved with music.In the 2nd half of the 16th century, during the religious troubles, Zutphen came under Protestant control.&amp;nbsp; From that time onwards the Catholic religion was forbidden in the northern part of the Netherlands.&amp;nbsp; Although some chapters (e.g. the Utrecht chapters) managed to continue until the end of the 18th century, the Zutphen chapter was disbanded round 1600.All chants not found in CAO are assigned arbitrary numbers prefixed by &quot;zut&quot;.</description>

    <summary>Late-15th-century antiphonal copied for the Sisters of the Common Life at the Augustinian abbey in Amersfoort, the Low Countries. Hufnagelschrift in brown/black ink on 4-line staves with F- and C-clefs. 6 staves per folio side. Cathedral cursus. Pars aestiva only. 190 paper leaves (one blank), plus one contemporary leaf with a single chant, and two front flyleaves. 21.3 x 14.6 cm with a principal writing-space of 15.2 x 9.8 cm.</summary>
    <liturgical_occasions>Ff. 001r-190r: Summer Temporale and Sanctorale. Ff. 001r-092r: Sanctorale from the feast of Mark (25 April) to Clement (23 November), including “In natali sancti Augustini episcopi patris nostri” (f. 055r) and “In translatione sancti Augustini” (f. 075r).

    <description>NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the pars aestiva, that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the pars hiemalis is yet to be found. 
Inside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, “Liber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.” Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women’s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.
Just beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears “Hymns Versicles and antiphons” in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller’s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.
The binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi¹⁰, vii-xviii⁸, xix⁶, xx⁸, xxi⁸+², xxii¹⁰, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from “A” to “[m]” on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), “[a]” to “F” on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from “a” to “[c]” on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (“1” on f. 000r, “2” on 011r, “3” on f. 021r, “4” on f. 031r, “5” on f. 041r, “6” on f. 051r, “7” on f. 061r, “8” on f. 069r, “9” on f. 077r, “10” on f. 085r, “11” on f. 093r, “12” on f. 101r, “13” on f. 109r, “14” on f. 117r, “15” on f. 125r, “16” on f. 133r, “17” on f. 141r, “18” on f. 149r, “19” on f. 157r, “20” on f. 163r, “21” on f. 171r, “22” on f. 181r).
The leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.</description>

    <description>The beginning of the manuscript is missing (from the first to the fourth Sunday of Advent). F. 7 is bound incorrectly as it contains some chants for the 4th Sunday of Advent; the correct folio is missing. After f. 146 there is an error in numeration: the folio following 146 is numbered as 141, with a duplication of numbers for five more folia. In the index, the second instances of 141 to 146 are identified as (recto,verso): 146w,x; 146y,z; 146a,b; 146c,d; 146e,f; 146g,h.The collegiate church in Kielce was founded in 1171 by Gedko (Gedeon), Bishop of Krakow. In 1882 it became the cathedral. The Cathedral Chapter Library in Kielce possesses over a dozen parchment manuscripts - the antiphoner from 1372 is considered to be the most precious. This antiphoner is the oldest one in the Krakow diocese. It shows many parallels with the sources from Krakow (such as ms. 52 and ms. 47 from Krakow Cathedral Chapter Library).</description>

    <description>Provenance (origin): one of the three original manuscripts for the Carmelite convent in Kraków (along with Kraków Ms.2 and Wrocław 12025/IV); copied in Prague and brought to Kraków for the foundation of the convent in 1397
Provenance (usage): Kraków, Carmelite convent
Provenance (subsequent history): still in the library of the Kraków Carmelite convent
Noteworthy Details: This is one of six antiphoners indexed by CANTUS that were used at the Carmelite convent in Kraków. The other five manuscripts are:
    Kraków, Klastor OO. Karmelitów na Piasku (Carmelite Convent), Ms.2 (rkp. Perg. 14)
    Kraków, Klastor OO. Karmelitów na Piasku (Carmelite Convent), Ms.3 (rkp. Perg. 15)

    Wrocław, Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, Biblioteka, Rkp. 12025/IV
[rkp. Perg. = Rękopis Pergament; The manuscripts still remaining at the Carmelite convent in Kraków have been numbered (Ms. 1 - Ms. 5) chronologically, earliest to latest, by James Boyce. The "rękopis" (Polish for 'manuscript') numbers assigned by Jerzy Gołos, who ordered the sources by size from largest to smallest, have been retained in parentheses with the abbreviation "rkp".]
The Carmelite convent in Prague was founded from Germany in 1347, and then the Kraków convent was founded from Prague. The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.
Kraków mss. 1-4 and the Wrocław manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.
This manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering “101/102” should follow the page numbered as “118,” and the leaf numbered as “119/120” should follow page 100.

This manuscript contains much of the same material as Ms. 1 (dated to 1397), with the addition of the rhymed office of the Three Marys, first accepted into the Carmelite liturgy by the General Chapter of Lyons in 1342. (The versions of this office as found in Mainz, Bischöfliches Dom- und Diözesanmuseum, E and in Florence, Santa Maria del Carmine - Biblioteca, Ms. 0 have been edited in Boyce, “The Office of the Three Marys ...”.)

    <summary>Antiphoner. 201 pp. Writing Material: parchment. 500 x 360 mm. Secular cursus.</summary>
    <description>Provenance (origin): one of the three original manuscripts for the Carmelite convent in Kraków (along with Kraków Mss.1 and 2); copied in Prague and brought to Kraków for the foundation of the convent in 1397
Provenance (usage): Kraków, Carmelite convent
Provenance (subsequent history): sold, and later entered the Biblioteka Narodowa "Ossolineum" of Wrocław
Noteworthy Details: This is one of six antiphoners indexed by CANTUS that were used at the Carmelite convent in Kraków. The other five manuscripts are:
    Kraków, Klastor OO. Karmelitów na Piasku (Carmelite Convent), Ms.1 (rkp. Perg. 12)

    [rkp. Perg. = Rękopis Pergament; The manuscripts still remaining at the Carmelite
    convent in Kraków have been numbered (Ms. 1 - Ms. 5) chronologically, earliest to
    latest, by James Boyce. The "rękopis" (Polish for 'manuscript') numbers assigned by
    Jerzy Gołos, who ordered the sources by size from largest to smallest, have been
    retained in parentheses with the abbreviation "rkp".]
    A dedicatory colophon in the Wrocław antiphonary gives the date as 1397 for the completion of the manuscript and names several Carmelite friars responsible for its production, including the scribe named Brother Leo, the prior provincial Brother Henry of Greuenberg, the prior of the Prague convent, Fr. Hartmann of Tachau and several other Carmelites, the most interesting of whom is Brother [presumably Fr.] Procopius, the cantor who directed the choir for forty-six years. (The first part of this inscription has been transcribed in Inwentarz Rękopisów Biblioteki Zakładu Narodowego im. Ossolińskich we Wrocławiu, Tom III, p. 24.)

    <summary>The explicit of this antiphoner indicates that it was copied in August 1491 by a certain Ioannes von Werd de Augusta (from Augsburg). Both manuscripts 18 and 19 were very probably commissioned by the parish church of Kranj (German: Krainburg) in the former Habsburg province of Carniola, now in Slovenia. They were a part of the medieval library of the parish church of Kranj and came to their present location during World War II. MS 18 is written in late Gothic notation; a diamond-shaped punctum is used for a single tone rather than a virga. The neumes are written on four-line, red staves. Secular cursus. 248 folios (fols. 8 and 9 are missing). 57.2 x 39.9 cm, principal writing space 45.2 x 28 cm. 12 lines on each side.</summary>

    <summary>The manuscript was most probably written by the same scribe as MS 18; however, there is no explicit or any other inscription concerning the date and place of its production.

    <summary>Antiphoner. "The Istanbul Antiphoner." 303 ff. Lacuna between ff. 203 and 204. 465 x 316 mm. Secular cursus.
Staff Notation: Esztergom (Hungarian) notation for first 294 folios. Ff. 295-303 consist of additions in different scripts.</summary>
    <description>Provenance (origin): the ecclesiastical province of Esztergom of medieval Hungary during the Angevin period (Dobszay, '"The Origin and Fate of the Codex,” p. 62).
Provenance (usage): Esztergom.
Provenance (subsequent history): During the Turkish occupation of Hungary (1526-1686), the codex was taken as booty to Istanbul (Ibid.).
Noteworthy details: In this codex are two complete Offices for Adalbert of Prague, the patron saint of the diocese of Esztergom: one for 23 April and one, commemorating the translation of Adalbert’s relics, for 6 November. According to Dobszay, the latter was a feast local to Esztergom (Dobszay, “The Liturgical Analysis of the Codex,” 47). The Sanctorale contains complete Offices for the following Hungarian saints: King Ladislaus, King Stephen I, Emeric and Elizabeth of Hungary. Added items at the end of the manuscript include two feasts prevalent in Hungarian sources: one for Queen Helen (mother of Emperor Constantine the Great) and one for Mary of the Snows (Ibid., 47, 52, 53).] The Istanbul Antiphoner is the only known source of the full Office for Andrew and Benedict that includes musical notation (Ibid., 51). Similarly, the Office for Anna contained in this source is known to appear in only one other source, the Esztergom Breviary (Ibid., 47).
Contributors to MS Description: ES (2005), ed. DL (Dec. 2006) 
Two invitatory tones found in the Istanbul Antiphoner have not yet been identified in other sources. They have been assigned the codes IS (associated with mode 2 antiphons) and IT (associated with mode 5 antiphons). The latter is included only in incipit in the manuscript. In addition, the invitatory tone labelled as “KN” in reference to the Klosterneuburg manuscripts (Liber Hymnarius, 162) is included in the Istanbul antiphoner. The incipit of what appears to be the ferial invitatory tone FE (owing to its usage in the manuscript) does not correspond to any of the full tones listed at the end of the book. It is associated once with a mode 4 antiphon and otherwise with mode 6 antiphons.
Marginalia that have not been indexed in this file owing to illegibility are referenced in the notes file (available from the CANTUS research office upon request).
There are two sets of foliation in pencil; in cases where the two sets do not match, the upper one (sometimes in parentheses) has been followed.</description>

    <summary>Franciscan antiphoner (sanctorale), origin unknown (? south Germany, Austria, Switzerland). 1300s. Leaves approximately 300 x 250 mm. Small square-note staff notation. Cathedral (curial-Franciscan) cursus. 119 folios (including 5 folios appended ms. at end); two main text hands, and three main music hands, some other text and music hands.</summary>
    <description>The office of Corpus Christi, copied by different hands, appears unusually among the proper of the saints (for August). Julian of Speyer&amp;rsquo;s office of Francis appears in calendrical sequence (4 Oct.), while the office of Clare (12 Aug.), a contrafactum of the Francis office, appears at the end of the proper, but in the same hands. Distinctive is the Magnificat antiphon at first vespers of Clare,&amp;nbsp;O decus et gaudium&amp;nbsp;(fol. 85r), a contrafactum of the Francis antiphon&amp;nbsp;O stupor et gaudium&amp;nbsp;(fol. 59v), not found elsewhere in CANTUS sources to date (2016); and, in the sequence for Francis,&amp;nbsp;Caeli cives in colono, music and words of an extra double verse,&amp;nbsp;Jam depulsa carnis mole&amp;nbsp;(fol. 114v), not previously reported. A polyphonic second voice has been added above the chant in the first half stanza of the sequence&amp;nbsp;Caeli solem imitantes&amp;nbsp;(fol. 89v), the only polyphonic source of this sequence, and the only example of polyphony in this manuscript.

    <description>A number of late additions (to the kalendar and in other marginal notes) suggest an association with Perugia (see van Dijk, 1956), but the location where the manuscript was first produced is uncertain. The manuscript has been at the Newberry Library since the late nineteenth century. The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. Differentiae that vary in terms only of immediately repeated notes, presence/absence of liquesence or neumation are give the same differentia code, but are distinguished with a lowercase letter in the first column of the &amp;ldquo;Extra&amp;rdquo; field.The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO in this index are consistent with those used for the other Franciscan manuscripts in the database:Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 693Assisi, Biblioteca comunale, 694Assisi, Cattedrale San Rufino - Archivio e Biblioteca, 5Budapest, Egyetemi Könyvtár (University Library), lat. 118, 119, 122, 121Città del Vaticano (Roma), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, lat. 8737Fribourg (Switzerland), Bibliothèque des Cordeliers, 2München, Bayersiche Staatsbibliothek, 12o Cmm 1 (St. Anna Kloster)Napoli, Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III, vi.

    <description>The fragment is a lone vellum bifolium that survives as the back pastedown in a copy of Leonhart Fuchs, De historia stirpium comentarii insignes (or Notable Commentaries on the History of Plants) (Basileae [Basel, Switzerland] [place of publication]: In officina Isingriniana [publisher], 1542), in the Peter H. Raven Library in St Louis (the Missouri Botanical Library), Shelfmark QK41.F8 1542, c.2.

The book, part of the collection of rare pre-Linnean volumes in the Missouri Botanical Garden Library, came to the Garden from the collection of E. Lewis Sturtevant (1842 –1898), a botanist and agriculturist. Sturtevant donated his personal collection of 463 volumes to the Garden in 1892. 
The fragment, which has been cropped at the top, bottom and sides, has four chants on it; two on the left-hand side (the verso) and two on the right-hand side. It is the remains of a varied collection of chants, perhaps originally a supplement on the end pages of a gradual. The production is non-deluxe. 4-line black staffs with German-style neumes. Black ink. There appear to be three different hands who have written these pieces, and there is more than one music scribe. On the left-hand page, the neumes are vertical strikes with head on the left; on the right-hand page, the head is on the right. No rubrication or decoration, except for a banderole, top of right-hand page, column b, with the words “De sancta elizabeth vidua” in it. 

Ruling:
Staffs ruled in ink. Distance between ruled lines of staff: ~0.4-5cm. Distance between lines where the writing appears ~ 1cm.

DIMENSIONS
Page:
~24.2cm h – x ~19.5cm (w – from gutter to edge of book) But it was originally bigger all round because the sides have been cropped. But not cropped that much because one knows the rest of the words of the chants, and not much is missing.
Number of lines:
10 lines of text are visible left-hand, column b, and also right-hand, column a.
Number of columns:
2
Height of minims:
There are possibly three hands. ~0.2cm, and smaller.
Space between lines: n/a
Height of written space: n/a
Width of written space: n/a
Upper margin:
Cropped.
Lower margin:
Cropped.
Space between columns:
~1.7 cm
Inner margin:

Outer margin:
